# Performance measurement plan

Status: provisional budgets, not accepted requirements. The owner's M4 MacBook Pro is the reference machine. The engineering rules every core and desktop change must follow are in [performance rules](../engineering/performance-rules.md). Fast interaction, background throughput and output correctness are evaluated separately.

## Reference workloads

| Workload | What it reveals |
| --- | --- |
| 24 MP and 60 MP JPEGs, EXIF-rotated variants, embedded sRGB/Adobe RGB/Display P3 profiles | First-open latency, memory, geometry and color |
| Huge or invalid dimensions, truncated files, malformed profiles | Resource bounds and error recovery |
| M4 with its actual display scale recorded; optional external SDR 4K | Preview, input, color, DPI and Metal resource measurements |
| Linux ARM64 VM, later native Windows/Linux GPU machines | Functional portability versus native GPU behavior, measured separately |
| 100,000 metadata rows; 1,000,000-row stress catalog | Index selection, pagination and startup independent of image bytes (later library) |
| At least 1,000 real images, then a larger owner dataset | Thumbnail decode and cache behavior synthetic rows cannot show |
| Local SSD, later removable SSD and NAS | CPU/GPU throughput versus storage latency |
| Nikon Z6 NEF, Fujifilm X100VI RAF and DJI Air 2S DNG in the owner's real modes | RAW decode/development, WB redevelopment, history, presentation and peak memory; see the [RAW integration contract](../design/raw-integration.md) |

Datasets need provenance, dimensions, profile and orientation, and redistribution permission. Synthetic fixtures live in the repository; private originals stay in a local manifest and are never committed.

## Provisional budgets

Engineering hypotheses until measured and accepted on the recorded M4 configuration, in SDR with the display contract recorded.

| Metric | Proposed budget |
| --- | --- |
| Launch to usable empty shell | p95 < 1 s warm, < 2 s cold |
| Uncached 24 MP JPEG to Fit preview | p95 < 750 ms; loading feedback within 100 ms |
| Crop overlay frame time | p95 ≤ 16.7 ms at 60 Hz |
| Slider input to presented frame at Fit, warm 24 MP | p95 < 16 ms; acceptable below 32 ms; a miss at or above 32 ms (owner's target of 2026-09-22) |
| RAW exposure drag at Fit, input to presented frame, Z6 and X100VI | p95 ≤ 50 ms |
| Burst drag (120 inputs per second for three seconds, alternating direction) | ≥ 30 presented frames per second; each presented frame's staleness p95 ≤ 50 ms |
| Settled exact histogram after the last input, 24 MP | p95 < 200 ms |
| Geometry input to presented preview | p95 < 50 ms once the source preview is ready |
| Empty steady-state process memory | ≤ 150 MiB including helper processes |
| 24 MP single-image edit working set | ≤ 600 MiB CPU-resident |
| 60 MP import or export peak | ≤ 1 GiB process RSS, GPU memory reported separately |
| Idle CPU | < 1% of one core over 30 s after background work settles |
| First page of a 100,000-row indexed filter | p95 < 100 ms warm (later library) |
| Warm adjacent-image Fit preview | p95 < 150 ms on a cache hit (later library) |

A single float32 RGBA buffer for 60 MP is about 916 MiB, so unrestricted full-resolution float processing needs tiling before it is promised.

## Recorded baselines

Native M4 Pro, release builds, warm filesystem cache, synthetic fixtures. Diagnostic observations, not accepted budgets or cross-platform claims.

### Sample counts for a p50/p95 claim

Every harness command's default run is a functional run: it proves the journey and gives one launch count you can quote, not a distribution. A p50/p95 figure requires an explicit sample count: 30 samples per recipe for `editor-performance`, 30 inputs for `editor-latency` (one launch), 30 trials per source for `raw-editor`, and at least 5 launches per workload for `measure` — 5 gives a median and a maximum, not a stable p95, so use 30 launches per workload for a p95 claim. Every recorded figure states the count it was taken with. The `measure` medians and p95 figures recorded below were taken with that tool's own interpolated median and its own uncapped `p95 = sorted[n·95/100]` index, before every timing tool shared one nearest-rank `Distribution` (`xtask/src/stats.rs`), so a `measure` figure taken after that change — most visibly its median at an even sample count, such as a 30-launch p95 claim — can read slightly differently from the same measurement recorded here.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| S0 viewer launch to observed frame (empty / 24 MP / 60 MP) | median 233 / 296 / 412 ms |
| S0 request to captured frame (24 / 60 MP) | median 237 / 361 ms |
| S0 sampled peak RSS (empty / 24 / 60 MP) | 111 / 506 / 772 MiB; 965 MiB after sixteen 60 MP loads |
| S0 idle CPU after settling | 0.033% of one core over 30 s |
| Core import of a 24 / 60 MP JPEG | 55 / 118 ms |
| Pixel edit after a rotate on 24 MP | 0.2 ms (sampling path) |
| Core one transform on 24 MP after the module registry (p50 / p95, 20 samples) | 12.2 / 13.5 ms; 200 composed transforms 11.4 / 11.9 ms; registration of the built-in modules 0.18 ms and first render after open 0.05 ms on the 480×320 fixture (release acceptance run) |
| Editor RSS after M1/M2 journey with a small fixture | about 101 MiB, 0.2% CPU idle |

### Host and build for the current JPEG editor baseline

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores), 48 GiB RAM, macOS 26.5.2 (25F84), Metal on the `Apple M4 Pro`
adapter, a 2880 × 1800 physical window at 2× scale; files on the internal APFS SSD. Release builds,
`--locked`, background-only launches, warm filesystem cache without an OS cache purge. Application
SHA-256 `2960abd8bcc922b43db7170e8579ff60df56a1177f86d8658e332dbb649239ed`, Cargo.lock SHA-256
`e1f96098ab03786e8976afd4e0ed78b0ed3d4c58cd071c032390552c97b4a600`. Fixtures are
`fixtures/generated/24mp.jpg` (6000 × 4000, SHA-256 `b54c2a15…`) and `fixtures/generated/60mp.jpg`
(10000 × 6000, SHA-256 `b9e0118a…`). The host is shared with other sessions: the one-minute load
average was between 2.3 and 5.7 at the start of every run recorded below, and the `editor-performance`
runs themselves drive the shared Rayon pool across all cores, so these are diagnostic samples on a
live machine, not a quiesced benchmark.

### Core render, one run, 30 samples per recipe

`editor-performance` on 24 and 60 MP, 30 samples each, release, warm cache. Every row below comes
from **one** invocation per size, so the rows are directly comparable to each other; earlier
per-task rows measured in separate runs are superseded (see the note after the table). This is
core request-to-render on the catalog owner's thread only: no desktop scheduling, GPU upload or
presentation. The colour rows all render the same 200-transform-and-10°-crop stack with one Basic
layer inserted where the host places a colour-stage commit, compiled by the real `luxforge.basic`
module, so the difference between a colour row and the baseline row is that unit's own per-pixel
work on identical frames.

| Measurement (p50 / p95 ms) | 24 MP | 60 MP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity recipe (shared source buffer, no frame allocated) | under 0.01 / 0.01 | under 0.01 / 0.01 |
| One exact transform | 10.9 / 15.0 | 24.6 / 38.5 |
| 200 transform actions folded into one orientation layer | 10.7 / 12.7 | 22.1 / 26.1 |
| The same stack with a 10° `crop-fit` on top | 33.7 / 68.9 | 69.7 / 85.4 |
| Colour baseline: the same stack, no colour layer | 32.8 / 41.4 | 69.7 / 74.6 |
| … with one `+1 EV` Basic layer (Exposure) | 48.3 / 55.9 | 111.9 / 120.7 |
| … with `+1 EV` and all five Tone fields | 80.8 / 105.2 | 196.4 / 210.8 |
| … with `vibrance 50, saturation 20` (the fused `ColourAdjust` unit) | 106.0 / 117.3 | 273.6 / 289.9 |
| … with `temperature 30, tint −10` (white balance) | 53.4 / 70.3 | 128.0 / 136.4 |
| `analysis::reduce_raster` alone, over an already-rendered raster | 6.9 / 7.7 | 17.4 / 27.5 |
| `query.neutral-sample`: the whole picker, 25 point samples | 0.01 / 0.03 | 0.02 / 0.03 |
| `crop-fit` commit: validation, fitting, compile and persistence, no render | 0.79 (single) | 0.85 (single) |
| Import | 54.4 (single) | 127.3 (single) |
| Reopen: source and preview job after a fresh `EditorService` | 30.5 (single) | 89.9 (single) |

The crop output stage measures 3695 × 2077 from the rotated 4000 × 6000 input at 24 MP and
5542 × 3116 from 6000 × 10000 at 60 MP. Against the colour baseline on the same run, each unit's own
added cost at the median is about 15 ms (24 MP) and 42 ms (60 MP) for Exposure's single multiply,
48 ms and 127 ms for Exposure plus the three composed Tone curve stages, 73 ms and 204 ms for the
fused Oklab `ColourAdjust`, and 21 ms and 58 ms for the one composite 3 × 3 linear-sRGB white-balance
matrix. The neutral picker is not a frame operation: it evaluates 25 point samples of the stage the
Basic layer receives at `O(layers)` each and allocates no frame, so its cost does not grow with the
pixel count.

**Superseded rows.** This table replaces the following earlier records, each of which came from its
own separate invocation on the same host and is no longer the current figure: the crop-module table
(one transform 10.7 / 11.2 ms and 22.7 / 26.0 ms, 200 composed transforms, and the 10° `crop-fit`
stack at 33.2 / 37.7 ms and 70.5 / 77.0 ms); the orientation-layer re-measurement of the 24 MP rows
(10.3 / 14.3, 10.5 / 11.1 and 31.5 / 34.0 ms, with the `crop-fit` commit falling from 1.2 to 0.6 ms
once it plans against a one-layer prefix); the Exposure row (56.3 / 123.4 ms and 129.4 / 221.3 ms,
whose tails followed the allocator rather than the pass); the Exposure-plus-Tone row (95.7 / 139.1 ms
and 235.0 / 264.7 ms); the separate-unit Vibrance/Saturation row (150.8 / 163.2 ms and
402.3 / 594.1 ms) and its fused replacement measured under heavy host load (107.6 / 112.4 ms and
357.8 / 440.3 ms); and the Temperature/Tint run (50.9 / 54.9 ms and 122.4 / 133.3 ms with its own
31.8 / 34.4 ms and 68.9 / 73.8 ms baseline). The conclusion those rows were recorded for still
holds — fusing Vibrance and Saturation into one Oklab round trip removed a whole conversion pair,
and `ColourAdjust` remains the most expensive single unit — but the numbers above are the ones to
quote.

### The masked colour primitive, its own run

A masked colour layer costs the units it would have cost unmasked, plus one coverage evaluation and
one blend per pixel **inside the mask's bounds rectangle**, and nothing at all outside it. Measured on
the host above, release, single invocation, three measured renders after one warm pass, over a
programmatically filled 6000 × 4000 frame with one `+1 EV` exposure unit
(`render::tests::masked_colour_cost_on_a_24_megapixel_frame`, an ignored measurement test):

| 24 MP render, one colour unit | ms per render |
| --- | --- |
| Identity recipe (shared source buffer) | under 0.05 |
| Unmasked | 42.9 |
| Masked, gradient bounds admitting 5.05% of the frame | 34.1 |
| Masked, gradient bounds admitting 100% of the frame | 45.6 |

So the bounds rectangle is worth 11.5 ms of the 45.6 here, and a mask over the whole frame costs
about 2.7 ms — 6% — more than no mask at all. The rectangle does **not** remove the pass's decode and
quantization of the rows it touches, because the frame must still be written: skipping a whole row
chunk when every operation in its run is masked and the chunk lies outside every rectangle is possible
and is not built. The unit-evaluation claim itself is asserted rather than inferred, by a counting
colour unit in
`render::tests::a_masked_operation_evaluates_no_unit_outside_its_bounds`, which requires the count to
equal the rectangle's area exactly.

`editor-performance` on 24 MP, 30 samples, after the change: colour baseline 33.1 / 38.3 ms and one
`+1 EV` Basic layer 40.3 / 45.5 ms, both inside the recorded ranges above, on a host whose load was
shared with other sessions. There is no paired before-run from this worktree; the unmasked path's
arithmetic is unchanged by construction and proved byte-identical by the colour tests, and the mask is
consulted once per operation per row rather than per pixel.

### The masked spatial primitive, one to four layers

A masked spatial layer costs what it would have cost unmasked, plus one coverage evaluation and one
blend per pixel of the tiles the mask's bounds rectangle reaches, minus the whole unit chain of every
tile it does not. Each spatial layer, masked or not, is a stage boundary and therefore a **sequential
full frame**: the design caps masked ones at four for that reason, and the host now refuses a fifth
with a `resource-limit` error naming the limit.

`cargo test --release --locked --package luxforge-core --lib -- --ignored masked_spatial_timing
--nocapture` (`render::spatial::tests::masked_spatial_timing`), on the host recorded above, on
in-memory synthetic frames rendered by the core alone, warm source and warm estimate store, p50 and
the slowest of 5 runs, one `luxforge.presence` clarity `+100` layer per mask. "Whole frame" is a
gradient whose bounds rectangle is the entire stage; "right-edge band" is one confined to about a
tenth of the columns. The tile counts are exact counters read from the host
(`masked_tile_counts`), not estimates. The load average rises during the run, because the render
drives the whole Rayon pool; the figure quoted is the one before it starts, which is the other
sessions' load and the only part of it a measurement can be spoiled by.

**These rows replace the contended first measurement.** The whole test was run twice back to back
on a quiesced host, one-minute load average 3.32 before the first pass and 5.12 and 6.81 before the
two halves of the second, against the 87.9 the first measurement was taken under. Both passes are
given, because the spread between two identical measurements is the only honest statement about how
quotable a millisecond from this machine is.

| Stage | Layers | Mask | p50 / slowest ms, pass 1 | p50 / slowest ms, pass 2 | Tiles copied / evaluated per render | Budget peak |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6000 × 4000 | 1 | none | 181 / 187 | 217 / 221 | 0 / 0 | 242.5 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 1 | whole frame | 204 / 206 | 243 / 261 | 0 / 96 | 255.3 MiB |

| 6000 × 4000 | 1 | none | 365 / 460 | 200 / 201 | 0 / 0 | 242.5 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 1 | right-edge band | 166 / 168 | 153 / 162 | 80 / 16 | 255.3 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 2 | right-edge band | 306 / 323 | 304 / 318 | 160 / 32 | 255.3 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 3 | right-edge band | 462 / 467 | 468 / 472 | 240 / 48 | 255.3 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 4 | right-edge band | 616 / 622 | 642 / 741 | 320 / 64 | 255.3 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 1 | none | 654 / 663 | 863 / 884 | 0 / 0 | 249.9 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 1 | whole frame | 809 / 816 | 831 / 852 | 0 / 240 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 2 | whole frame | 1648 / 1651 | 1654 / 1699 | 0 / 480 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 3 | whole frame | 2545 / 2800 | 2550 / 2743 | 0 / 720 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 4 | whole frame | 3354 / 3480 | 3263 / 3269 | 0 / 960 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 1 | none | 680 / 684 | 687 / 693 | 0 / 0 | 249.9 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 1 | right-edge band | 407 / 416 | 394 / 413 | 204 / 36 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 2 | right-edge band | 807 / 810 | 783 / 786 | 408 / 72 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 3 | right-edge band | 1196 / 1208 | 1179 / 1198 | 612 / 108 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 4 | right-edge band | 1592 / 1613 | 1593 / 1694 | 816 / 144 | 239.7 MiB |

**Scope.** The quiesced figures are in the same place as the delivered unmasked quiesced figure for
the same operation (191 / 202 ms at 24 MP), which is what says the host was quiet: three of the four
measurements of the identical unmasked 24 MP work read 181, 200 and 217 ms, against 353 and 543 ms
when the same rows were taken at load 87.9. **One of the four read 365 ms and is an outlier**, and
the 24 MP four-layer pass-1 slowest of 1991 ms against a pass-2 slowest of 919 ms is another; this
machine is shared and a stray minute still lands in a five-sample window. The masked rows themselves
are steady — every masked pair above agrees to within 10% except the 24 MP four-layer row — so these
are quotable as the cost of a masked Presence layer, with that spread stated.

- **Cost grows with the layer count, linearly.** At 60 MP whole frame the four masked rows are 809,
  1648, 2545, 3354 ms: 809 ms per layer, flat. At 24 MP they are 204, 408, 693, 1088. That is what a
  sequential full frame per layer predicts, and it is why four is the cap: a fourth masked spatial
  layer at 60 MP costs the person three and a third seconds of exact render, and it is the *exact*
  phase, behind the proxy, so it is not what the hand feels.
- **A tile outside the bounds rectangle costs no unit evaluation**, exactly: 204 of 240 tiles copied
  at 60 MP and 80 of 96 at 24 MP, so a small mask is *cheaper* than the unmasked layer — 394–407 ms
  against 654–863 at 60 MP, 153–166 against 181–217 at 24 MP, a saving of about 40% and 20%. That is
  a counter rather than an inference.
- **A whole-frame mask costs 12–13% over no mask at one layer at 24 MP** (204 against 181 in pass 1,
  243 against 217 in pass 2). At 60 MP the two passes disagree — 809 against 654 is +24%, 831
  against 863 is −4% — so at 60 MP the honest statement is that the whole-frame mask costs
  **somewhere between nothing and a quarter** of the unmasked layer at one layer, and the 24 MP
  figure is the quotable one. The structural part of it is the working set: a masked tile holds one
  extra tile-sized plane, the snapshot the blend is against, which at 60 MP moves the plan's
  concurrency from 8 tiles to 7.
- The blend is **in place** in the last unit's planes. An earlier spelling that copied the tile out
  and blended into a second buffer measured 4464 ms against 1873 at 60 MP — a 2.4× overhead from two
  fresh tile-sized allocations per tile, not from arithmetic. That spelling is not what shipped, and
  it is recorded because it is the trap: the blend is cheap and the allocations were not.

On the **RAW linear path** each spatial operation materializes one `f32` frame, and each frame
replaces the one before it, so at most two exist at once whatever the number of masked spatial
layers, as on the byte path.

### The masked spatial primitive, tiles the mask leaves uncovered inside its bounds

A masked Presence layer (Clarity +100) on an in-memory 6000 × 4000 frame whose mask reaches most of
its bounds rectangle but covers little of it: a diagonal gradient, an inverted radial (bounds are the
whole stage) and a luminance range (a value-based component, whose bounds are always the whole
stage). Each is rendered under the rule before tiles were proved uncovered one by one — copy only
outside `bounds()` — and under the proof, alternating run by run and swapping which goes first, with
every pair of frames asserted byte-identical. `cargo test --release --locked --package luxforge-core
--lib -- --ignored masked_spatial_zero_coverage_timing --nocapture`, M4 MacBook Pro, p50 and the
slowest of 6 runs each.

| Mask | Outside bounds only: p50 / slowest ms | Proved per tile: p50 / slowest ms | Tiles copied / evaluated, before → after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Diagonal gradient toward the top-left corner | 300 / 1466 | 268 / 1154 | 16 / 80 → 37 / 59 |
| Inverted radial (a vignette) | 262 / 294 | 213 / 406 | 0 / 96 → 33 / 63 |
| Luminance range 70 to 100 | 297 / 396 | 223 / 242 | 0 / 96 → 45 / 51 |

**Provisional.** The one-minute load average was 9.9 before the run and 22.5 after it, well above
the 8.0 a quotable figure needs, so the milliseconds are an upper bound and the slowest column is
noise. The tile counts are exact counters (`masked_tile_counts`) and are the result: a third to a
half of the tiles skip the unit chain, and the p50 falls by 11 to 25% in the same interleaved run.
The saving in wall time is smaller than the share of tiles because a render also pays for the global
estimate and the fill, and the tiles that remain still run in parallel.

### The masked spatial primitive, a mask of many components

The other half of the same cost: one masked Presence layer whose mask holds 1, 4, 16 and 32
components — [the limit](../design/masking.md) — each a linear gradient across the whole frame, so
the bounds rectangle is the whole stage and **every** component is evaluated at every pixel. The
modes cycle through add, subtract and intersect, because those are one `max` and two `min`s per
pixel and nothing else. `cargo test --release --locked --package luxforge-core --lib -- --ignored
masked_spatial_component_timing --nocapture`, same host, same warm-up, p50 and the slowest of 5
runs, one-minute load average 5.12 at the start.

| Stage | Components | p50 / slowest ms | Tiles copied / evaluated | Budget peak |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6000 × 4000 | 1 | 216 / 226 | 0 / 96 | 255.3 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 4 | 239 / 305 | 0 / 96 | 255.3 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 16 | 306 / 311 | 0 / 96 | 255.3 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | 32 | 380 / 384 | 0 / 96 | 255.3 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 1 | 844 / 844 | 0 / 240 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 4 | 877 / 891 | 0 / 240 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 16 | 1042 / 1060 | 0 / 240 | 239.7 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | 32 | 1204 / 1243 | 0 / 240 | 239.7 MiB |

**A component is cheap and the cost is linear in the count.** Thirty-one further components add
164 ms at 24 MP and 360 ms at 60 MP — **5.3 ms and 11.6 ms each**, a ratio of 2.2 against the 2.5
the pixel counts predict, which is what a per-pixel field evaluation looks like. A mask at the
32-component limit costs 76% more than a one-component mask at 24 MP and 43% more at 60 MP, and the
whole 32-component evaluation is still smaller than the Presence chain it modulates. The limit of 32
is not a performance limit at these sizes; it is a limit on how much a person can keep track of.
This is the worst case by construction: a real mask's components have bounded supports, and a
component whose support the tile does not touch is not evaluated there at all.

### The brush's own workload

What a painted mask costs, as against the gradients whose cost is already recorded above: its compile
(the grid index over segments, built before a pixel is read), the rectangle it bounds, the render it
modulates, and the point query it answers. `cargo test --release --locked --package luxforge-core
--lib -- --ignored masked_brush_cost_on_photo_sized_frames --nocapture`
(`render::tests::masked_brush_cost_on_photo_sized_frames`, an ignored measurement test), on the M4
MacBook Pro, release, one warm-up render then the mean of three, twenty compiles, and a thousand
point queries spread over the frame. **One-minute load average 3.96 before the run and 9.87 after**,
the run itself taking 8.8 s; the figures below are therefore taken on a quiet host by the
[reliability rule](#provisional-targets-measured), and the rise is this measurement's own tail.

Every stroke is the panel's own brush — radius 0.05 mask-space units, which is 200 px on a 24 MP
stage, feather 50, flow 100 — laid as a three-position path across its own band of the frame, so the
strokes neither coincide nor leave it. The masked layer is one Exposure unit, the same one the
masked-colour row above uses, so the difference between the rows is the mask and nothing else.

| Mask on one Exposure layer | 24 MP ms | 60 MP ms | Rectangle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None (unmasked exposure) | 35.2 | 83.4 | — |
| Whole-frame linear gradient | 66.6 | 174.6 | 100% |
| Brush, 1 stroke | 41.5 | 105.3 | 10.5% |
| Brush, 8 strokes | 103.2 | 250.4 | 71.2% |
| Brush, 32 strokes | 152.3 | 384.8 | 77.7% |
| Brush, 64 strokes — [the limit](../design/masking.md) | 213.9 | 537.0 | 78.8% |

- **A brush is a gradient with a smaller rectangle.** One stroke costs 41.5 ms against the
  whole-frame gradient's 66.6 at 24 MP, because its conservative rectangle admits a tenth of the
  frame and the pass skips the rest — the same saving the masked colour primitive's own rows record.
  A mask is never free: one stroke is 6.3 ms over no mask at all at 24 MP and 21.9 at 60 MP.
- **Each further stroke costs about 2 ms per 24 MP frame and 5 ms per 60 MP frame**, once the
  rectangle has stopped growing: 8 → 32 strokes is 2.0 and 5.6 ms a stroke, 32 → 64 is 1.9 and
  4.8 ms, a ratio of 2.5 against the 2.5 the pixel counts predict. That is what a per-pixel field
  evaluation looks like, and it is the same shape the component table above measures.
- **The compile is not a cost worth naming.** Building the grid index and checking the occupancy cap
  takes 0.003 ms for one stroke and 0.029 ms for sixty-four at 24 MP, and less at 60 MP because the
  work is in the strokes rather than the stage. It is charged to the gesture, once, before a pixel is
  read — a thousandth of the frame it precedes.
- **A point query stays a point query.** `Render::sample` through a brush mask answers in 0.0023 ms
  at one stroke and 0.0385 ms at sixty-four, on both stage sizes: it rasterizes nothing
  ([rule 4](../engineering/performance-rules.md#rules)), and the cost it does have is the segments
  the index leaves near that pixel. Even at the stroke limit it is a four-hundredth of a display
  frame, so the pointer readout and the eyedropper are unaffected by how much has been painted.

**Scope.** These are exact-phase renders of the whole frame on the calling thread, which is what the
histogram, the overlays and the 100% view take; what a hand feels during a stroke is the proxy phase,
whose masked figures are in [Masks in the proxy phase](#masks-in-the-proxy-phase) below. The 64-stroke
row is a worst case by construction — sixty-four full-width strokes is far past the point where a
second component is the better answer — and it is the delivered per-component limit rather than a
recommendation.

### Masks in the proxy phase

A masked recipe is proxy eligible by construction: mask geometry is stored normalized, so the mask
compiled against the proxy stage is the same field at a smaller scale and the proxy frame is the
exact recipe at proxy size. The only thing that changes with the stage is sampling, and the recorded
default ([masking](../design/masking.md#point-queries-and-proxies), proposal P5) supersamples the
**mask field only**, 2 × 2 per pixel, when the mask's narrowest feature is under two pixels of the
proxy stage.

Core cost of the proxy render a drag presents, measured on the host above, release, 25 measured
renders after one warm pass against a cached proxy source, display bounds 2880 × 1800
(`proxy::tests::measure_the_masked_proxy_render_on_photo_sized_sources`, an ignored measurement
test). One-minute load average 6.8 at the start and 7.1 at the end, so these are **provisional**
figures on a host shared with other sessions, not a quiesced baseline.

| Proxy render, full Basic layer | 24 MP → 2700 × 1800 | 60 MP → 2880 × 1728 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unmasked | 26.6 / 28.9 ms | 29.3 / 32.8 ms |
| Masked, broad gradient, point sampled | 23.7 / 27.0 ms | 25.7 / 29.2 ms |
| Masked, thin gradient, point sampled | 17.7 / 20.0 ms | 19.0 / 23.6 ms |
| Masked, thin gradient, 2 × 2 supersampled | 19.8 / 21.2 ms | 20.4 / 22.3 ms |

p50 / p95. The last two rows are the **same stack at the same size**, so their difference is the
thin-feature rule alone: **+2.1 ms p50 at 24 MP and +1.4 ms at 60 MP**, 7–12%, for four coverage
evaluations per covered pixel instead of one. A mask never costs more than no mask here, because its
bounds rectangle skips the spans it cannot reach — the same saving the masked colour primitive's own
run records — so the rule's cost is paid only inside the selection.

Desktop input-to-presented-frame for a slider drag at Fit, full Basic layer, `editor-latency --mode
drag --basic`, 30 samples, two runs at each size:

| Drained drag at Fit | 24 MP | 60 MP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p50 | 17.8 / 17.6 ms | 21.5 / 17.6 ms |
| p95 | 48.2 / 123.5 ms | 26.2 / 26.0 ms |
| min | 16.1 / 16.4 ms | 15.8 / 15.5 ms |

Against the provisional target of p95 below 16 ms with 32 ms acceptable: **the p50 is 17.6–17.8 ms on
both sources and the minimum is 15.5–16.4 ms, so the target is missed at the median by under two
milliseconds; the p95 is not a usable figure from this host.** The one-minute load average was 11.1
and 8.8 for the first pair and 5.8 and 6.5 for the second, all at or above the 8.0 the reliability
rule in [provisional targets](#provisional-targets-measured) sets for quoting a baseline, and the
24 MP p95 of 123.5 ms comes from a single outlier against a maximum of 123.9 ms and a p50 of 17.6 ms.
These figures are recorded as provisional and are a finding for the owner, not a verdict. `draft.set`
round trip was 0.21 ms p50 in every run, unchanged, which is the hop rule holding.

#### An end-to-end masked slider drag

This is now drivable and was taken. `editor-latency --mask` draws a linear gradient through
`mask.create-linear`, enters Mask mode and opens the mask **by the name the host gave it** — the
evidence script resolves a `{"name": …}` reference against the `mask.list` answer the desktop holds,
which is what removed the blocker recorded here before: `mask.create` assigns the identity, so a
script that creates a mask has nothing else to name it by. From the selection on, every generated
slider gesture carries that mask, exactly as the panel's own drag does. With `--basic` beside it the
measured stack holds a global full-Basic layer *and* a masked Basic layer, so each frame runs the
module's whole colour pass twice, once of it through the masked colour primitive.

**These figures replace the first, contended ones, which were taken at load 39.5 to 57.5 and are
withdrawn.** Eight runs, 30 samples each, drag mode, at Fit, taken back to back and then reversed —
24 MP unmasked, 24 MP masked, 60 MP unmasked, 60 MP masked, then the same four in the opposite
order — each preceded by a 100-second pause, so the one-minute load average read beside it is the
*other sessions'* load and not this measurement's own tail. Those loads are in the last row. The
two figures in each cell are the forward run and the reversed one.

| Drained drag at Fit, `--basic` | 24 MP unmasked | 24 MP masked | 60 MP unmasked | 60 MP masked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p50 | — / 16.93 ms | 16.77 / 17.13 ms | 17.00 / 17.48 ms | 17.06 / 17.87 ms |
| p95 | — / 91.7 ms | 25.3 / 25.7 ms | 25.4 / 26.8 ms | 25.1 / 26.2 ms |
| min | — / 15.12 ms | 15.45 / 15.74 ms | 15.25 / 15.46 ms | 15.70 / 15.44 ms |
| `draft.set` round trip p50 | — / 0.226 ms | 0.227 / 0.231 ms | 0.214 / 0.215 ms | 0.231 / 0.236 ms |
| one-minute load before the run | — / 4.19 | 8.13 / 3.37 | 3.65 / 3.32 | 2.34 / 2.58 |

**The first run of the sequence is discarded and is shown as `—`.** It measured p50 41.40 ms, p95
135.7, min 25.95 and a `draft.set` of 0.395 ms — every one of them roughly double every other run's,
including the hop, which no amount of render load moves. It was the first launch after the machine
had been idle, so it paid for cold shader, filesystem and allocator state; the identical run at the
other end of the sequence read 16.93 ms. That is a finding about the harness and not about masking,
and it is recorded rather than averaged away: **the first `editor-latency` launch after an idle
period is not a usable sample.**

**A mask costs a person's hand nothing measurable.** Every remaining p50 is between 16.8 and
17.9 ms, masked and unmasked, at both sizes. The largest difference between a masked run and its
unmasked pair is 0.4 ms, which is smaller than the difference between the two runs of the same
condition. A second set of eight runs taken back to back with no pause between them — and therefore
at load 12.1 to 17.4, this measurement's own tail — agrees: 17.64 and 16.75 ms 24 MP unmasked,
16.63 and 16.52 masked, 16.23 and 16.12 ms 60 MP unmasked, 15.76 and 15.91 masked.

- `draft.set` round trip p50 is **0.214–0.226 ms unmasked and 0.227–0.236 ms masked** — a mask
  target adds about 0.01–0.02 ms to the gesture's own hop, on every run, in both orders. The hop
  rule holds through the masked path.
- The queue counters are identical in all sixteen runs: 31 scripted values in the burst step
  coalesced into **1** `draft.set`, 32 `draft.set` requests, 32 preview jobs requested and **0**
  superseded, two commits. A masked drag coalesces and drains exactly as an unmasked one does;
  nothing about the mask adds a round trip, a job or a dropped frame.
- Every run passed its own scripted-step checks, so each measured input is the scripted value with
  its own `draft.set`, preview job and displayed frame.

Against the provisional target (p95 below 16 ms, acceptable below 32 ms): **every run is inside the
acceptable bound at the p95 and every one misses the 16 ms target, and masking does not change
which.** The one exception is the 24 MP unmasked p95 of 91.7 ms, a single stray sample against that
run's own minimum of 15.1 ms and p50 of 16.9. The median misses the target by about a millisecond
everywhere. That is the same miss the unmasked rows above already record.

#### A masked Presence slider

The figure this document previously recorded as outstanding. `editor-latency --action set-presence
--parameter clarity`, with and without `--mask`, 24 MP, 30 samples, drag mode, at Fit, taken in both
orders with the same 100-second pause before each. Clarity is a spatial operation and therefore a
stage boundary, so this is the hand's-eye view of the row the core table above measures at exact
size.

| Drained Clarity drag at Fit, 24 MP | unmasked | masked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p50 | 17.00 / 17.10 ms | 17.18 / 17.10 ms |
| p95 | 18.2 / 25.4 ms | 18.6 / 24.0 ms |
| min | 14.64 / 14.86 ms | 14.04 / 15.27 ms |
| `draft.set` round trip p50 | 0.202 / 0.209 ms | 0.226 / 0.237 ms |
| one-minute load before the run | 3.67 / 1.85 | 3.96 / 1.99 |

**A masked Presence drag is indistinguishable from an unmasked one at the median**: 17.10–17.18 ms
against 17.00–17.10, a difference of at most 0.18 ms against a run-to-run spread of 0.10 ms in
either condition. The hop pays the same 0.02–0.03 ms a masked Basic drag does. The queue counters
are again identical: 31 values into 1 `draft.set`, 0 superseded. Masked Presence therefore meets the
same provisional bound the unmasked spatial slider does — acceptable at the p95, missing the 16 ms
target at the median by about a millisecond. This is the proxy phase, which is what the hand feels;
the exact phase behind it is the core table above.

`editor-performance --samples 30` was re-run on the same host beside the first, contended drags,
release, warm cache, on `24mp.jpg` (load average 8.6 rising to 17.3) and `60mp.jpg` (load average
17.3 rising to 20.8). Both **passed every check**, including that the catalog reopen reconstructs the
original historical state and the source SHA-256 is unchanged, so the phase leaves the core's own
correctness diagnostics intact. Their timings are not quoted, for the reason the drags were not: the
harness's own full-Basic core render read 128.2 ms p50 / 224.5 ms p95 at 24 MP and 527.1 / 619.1 ms
at 60 MP, and a p95 more than 1.7 times its own p50 in a warm 30-sample loop is a measure of the
host's queue, not of the render.

#### A painted stroke's own latency

The `editor-latency --mode paint` workload measures a brush stroke at a fixed 24 ms input pace.
The harness pairs each `mask_draft_set` with the preview generation returned for that edit and then
with the corresponding `preview_displayed` event. The editor emits `mask_draft_preview` for that
pairing. When diagnostics are enabled for the paint measurement, the queue and worker record request
to worker-start and worker-render durations; ordinary preview requests remain untimed. The scripted
stroke step accepts `interval_ms` and sends one point per timer tick, so the sample is a continuous
stroke with one history entry, not a sequence of released strokes.

The four-layer correctness scenario and the bare-recipe photo-sized workload use different recipes
and should not be combined into one estimate. The bare-recipe phase table below isolates the
per-generation owner, queue, worker and surface intervals.

#### The four-layer figure, from the correctness run

The `mask-range` scenario's own, recorded in its `result.json` beside the recipe they were taken on and
the load the host was under. Twelve positions at a 24 ms interval — a little over the delivered
masked-drag median of 16.8–17.9 ms, so each position has a round trip of its own to finish — painted
down the middle of one flat patch of a 1440 × 960 fixture. Two runs, back to back, on a quiet host.

| Painted stroke, `mask_draft_set` → `preview_displayed` | run 1 | run 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p50 | 32.6 ms | 32.2 ms |
| p95 | 50.2 ms | 42.1 ms |
| drafted frames displayed / inputs | 11 / 17 | 10 / 17 |
| one-minute load average | 1.58 | 1.80 |

**Against the provisional target (p95 under 16 ms, acceptable under 32 ms) this is a miss at both
bounds, stated plainly: the p50 alone is already at or past the acceptable p95.** The load average is
well under the 8.0 a quotable figure needs, so it is not the host.

That recipe is also the heaviest the scenario builds: **four masked colour layers**, three of whose masks
hold a luminance range or a colour range. A value-based component answers the *whole stage* for its
conservative rectangle, by [P13](../design/range-study.md#proposals), so those three layers are
evaluated at every pixel with no span skipped — the cost the range study measured at 28–44 ns per pixel
over 100% of the stage, against a placed gradient's 14.6–20.0 ns over 40%. It was recorded here with
the reading that most of the figure was that recipe. **The bare-recipe measurement below withdraws
that reading**, and the correction is the more useful of the two results.

#### Bare recipe at photo size, with phase attribution

`editor-latency --mode paint` opens one generated photo-sized JPEG, prepares a single brush mask and
one masked Basic exposure layer, then sends a 30-position stroke at 24 ms intervals. The parser
starts at that scripted stroke step, so setup edits do not enter its latency or superseded counts.
The preview queue remains one active job plus one replaceable pending job; every frame is paired to
the generation its own `mask_draft_preview` named. Release build, warm file cache, background hidden
window on the Apple M4 Pro, 2880 × 1800 physical window at 2× scale. All presented phases were the
1716 × 1144 display proxy. One run per size, no competing build or test; start/end one-minute load
was 3.91/3.91 for 24 MP and 3.46/3.46 for 60 MP.

| Phase (p50 / p95 ms) | 24 MP, 6000 × 4000 | 60 MP, 10000 × 6000 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `mask_draft_set` → `preview_displayed` | 19.23 / 40.70 | 17.71 / 35.06 |
| Owner round trip to preview request | 0.18 / 5.96 | 0.12 / 0.65 |
| `draft.set` on owner | 0.04 / 3.23 | 0.03 / 0.16 |
| Preview-job planning on owner | 0.13 / 4.34 | 0.09 / 0.19 |
| Preview request → worker start | 6.63 / 18.17 | 8.59 / 17.40 |
| Worker render | 4.63 / 5.43 | 4.14 / 4.45 |
| Pre-result residual | 7.29 / 20.28 | 4.97 / 22.41 |
| Worker result → surface assignment | 0.02 / 0.04 | 0.01 / 0.02 |

The owner executor wait and return-to-queue legs stayed below 0.01 ms in these samples. The
pre-result residual is the remaining time from the input event through the request timestamp and
from worker completion until the app polls the result; it does not identify one function. Phase
percentiles are independent distributions and must not be summed. The request-to-worker interval
includes time behind an active job and thread scheduling. GPU texture upload and display scanout
were not measured; the last row is only the app's surface-assignment event.

| Workload resources | 24 MP | 60 MP |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Displayed positions / 30 | 26 | 24 |
| Superseded positions | 4 | 6 |
| Process CPU seconds for the whole evidence launch | 7.34 | 8.73 |
| Sampled peak process RSS | 785.4 MiB | 1288.2 MiB |
| Shared colour scratch high-water mark | 15.12 MB | 15.12 MB |

The CPU total includes source opening, initial rendering, the gesture, evidence captures and process
exit; it is not a per-frame CPU measurement. Peak RSS includes captures and GPU resources and is not
a CPU-heap figure. The 60 MP peak from this capture-heavy run is not comparable to the normal-open
working-set target above. The synthetic fixtures isolate image dimensions and fixed per-pixel work;
they are not camera-photo content.

**The measurable tail is scheduling and delivery rather than the pixel kernel.** Worker render p95
is 4.45–5.43 ms, and surface assignment is at most 0.04 ms, while input-to-surface p95 remains
35.06–40.70 ms. Queue wait and the pre-result residual dominate the tails; some owner `draft.set`
round trips also have a several-millisecond tail on 24 MP. This does not justify SIMD, assembly, a
GPU rewrite or changing the mask renderer yet. Keep the bounded queue and cancellation rules while
tracing whether the remaining gap comes from the active-job handoff or the desktop event loop.

### Desktop slider-to-presented-frame and settled histogram

`editor-latency`, release, warm cache, background evidence launches on the host above, 30 samples
each. This is the desktop measurement the core rows cannot make. **Presented means the desktop's
`Uploaded` message**, recorded as the `preview_displayed` event: the rendered pixels have become a
renderer texture and the canvas draws them from the next frame on. It is **not** display scanout,
which the harness cannot observe, so every figure is an upper bound on the editor's own work and a
lower bound on what an eye sees. The window these runs measure is invisible, so nothing is
composited or scanned out in them at all.

Each measured input is one scripted `slider` step left open, so the step settles only when the
gesture has drained: one input, one `draft.set`, one preview job, one upload, with nothing from the
previous input still in flight. The interval runs from the `slider_draft_set` event to the
`preview_displayed` of the preview generation that `draft.set` produced, correlated by generation
and cross-checked against the draft revision on both ends.

| Interaction (p50 / p95 ms, 30 samples) | 24 MP | 24 MP + 7° crop | 60 MP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input to presented frame | 74.8 / 83.4 | 150.3 / 170.2 | 125.0 / 141.3 |
| … of which `draft.set` round trip on the owner | 8.3 / 9.2 | 32.7 / 34.2 | 8.2 / 16.7 |
| … of which render and GPU upload | 66.6 / 75.1 | 117.9 / 143.8 | 116.7 / 133.1 |
| … of which the GPU upload the desktop times itself | 32.5 / 33.6 | 33.4 / 50.9 | 49.7 / 50.5 |
| Final input to settled exact histogram | 99.7 / 107.0 | 184.7 / 213.3 | 185.4 / 208.8 |
| … of which commit to settled histogram | 91.6 / 100.1 | 176.3 / 208.4 | 177.4 / 200.3 |

The settled-histogram rows come from a companion `--mode commit` run of 30 samples, where each step
is a whole gesture moved and released at once, so every sample is one committed frame and its own
exact report. A drafted preview is never analysed — the design keeps the plot labelled stale during
a gesture — so the exact histogram is always reduced from the frame the commit's own refresh
renders, and `analysis_adopted` is the moment that frame and its report are adopted together. The
drag runs measure the same interval once each and agree: 74.8 / 90.3 ms at 24 MP, 239.5 / 248.3 ms
on the crop stack and 182.2 / 200.9 ms at 60 MP, from two commits each.

The crop stack is slower than plain 60 MP at the input-to-frame median because its `draft.set` round
trip is four times longer: the owner replans the crop prefix on every set. Its render and upload are
close to 60 MP's despite a much smaller output stage (5653 × 3180), which is the crop resample's own
interpolating pass.

### Queue cancellation during a gesture

From the same runs, counted out of the event log. Two separate bounds hold.

| Observation | 24 MP drag | 24 MP commit | 60 MP drag | 60 MP commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scripted slider values | 62 | 30 | 62 | 30 |
| `draft.set` requests sent | 32 | 30 | 32 | 30 |
| Preview jobs requested | 32 | 30 | 32 | 30 |
| Preview jobs superseded before display | 2 | 30 | 2 | 30 |
| Commits | 2 | 30 | 2 | 30 |
| Analysis reports adopted | 3 | 31 | 3 | 31 |
| Analysis jobs superseded | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The first bound is the gesture driver's. A drag step that sends 31 values between two ticks produces
exactly **one** `draft.set` and one preview job: the driver keeps at most one round trip in flight
and only the newest value waiting, so intermediate values are coalesced and never reach the owner at
all. That is why 62 scripted values become 32 requests in the drag runs.

The second bound is the preview queue's. Every commit supersedes the drafted preview of the value it
commits, because the commit's own refresh requests a newer generation before the drafted pixels are
uploaded; the superseded frame is rejected on generation rather than drawn. In the commit runs all
30 drafted previews are superseded this way. In the drag runs only the two releases supersede
anything, because the open steps drain one at a time by construction. **No analysis job is
superseded in any run**: a drafted preview is never analysed, so the only reductions are the ones
belonging to committed frames, and each is adopted with the pixels it was reduced from.

### Memory, scratch and idle with a full Basic layer

`editor-latency --idle` holds one 24 MP image with a Basic layer in which all ten fields are
non-neutral (`exposure 0.5, contrast 25, highlights −30, shadows 30, whites −15, blacks 15,
temperature 20, tint −10, vibrance 30, saturation 15`) and the histogram on — the tools panel is
open by default and the captured state confirms `tools_panel: true` with the plot `ready` and not
stale. RSS is sampled by `ps` about every 50 ms and includes captures, GPU resources and allocator
retention; it is not a CPU-heap figure and GPU memory is not separated.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Peak RSS, 24 MP, gesture process committing the full Basic layer | 645.3 MiB |
| Peak RSS, 24 MP, second process holding that committed layer | 568.2 MiB, settling to 408.0 MiB |
| Idle CPU, 24 MP with the full Basic layer, 30 s after settling | 1.46% of one core |
| Scratch budget high-water mark, 24 MP colour pass | 14 112 000 B (13.46 MiB) of the 64 MiB target |
| Scratch budget high-water mark, 60 MP colour pass | 13 440 000 B (12.82 MiB) of the 64 MiB target |
| Peak RSS during a 30-input 24 MP latency run (32 window captures retained) | 1336.5 MiB |
| Peak RSS during a 30-input 60 MP latency run (32 window captures retained) | 2143.0 MiB |

The scratch figure is the point of `ScratchBudget::peak`: a reservation is released as soon as its
chunk is done, so `in_use` read from outside a pass is always zero and only the high-water mark says
what the budget carried. It is stable across image size because the colour pass streams bounded row
chunks — at most one megabyte of `[f32; 3]` per Rayon worker — so scratch scales with the worker
count, not the pixel count. The two latency-run peaks are **not** working-set figures: those runs
retain a full-window PNG readback for each of 32 captured frames, which is harness cost, and they are
recorded only so the number is not mistaken for one later.

### Editor process measurements, before and after this work

`measure`, five app-cold launches per workload plus one repeated 60 MP run, on the host above. The
"before" column is the binary built from `3c5def1` (`main` before the Basic panel and histogram,
SHA-256 `ff9eecab…`), measured in the same session minutes apart from the same fixtures, so the two
columns share host conditions. Launch to observed frame is an upper bound: it includes the temporary
background bundle, the executable copy and the harness's capture readback, not scanout.

| Measurement | Before `3c5def1` | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launch to observed frame, empty (median / p95) | 632.9 / 689.7 ms | 671.2 / 751.7 ms |
| Launch to observed frame, 24 MP (median / p95) | 689.3 / 734.7 ms | 734.7 / 742.5 ms |
| Launch to observed frame, 60 MP (median / p95) | 802.6 / 859.0 ms | 808.8 / 857.4 ms |
| Sampled peak RSS (empty / 24 / 60 MP, median) | 143.7 / 489.2 / 967.4 MiB | 133.2 / 466.0 / 975.0 MiB |
| Sampled peak RSS after sixteen 60 MP loads | 1316.0 MiB | 1316.4 MiB |
| Open request to captured frame (24 / 60 MP, median) | 219.7 / 314.1 ms | 222.2 / 314.3 ms |
| … of which GPU upload (24 / 60 MP, median) | 21.3 / 55.8 ms | 21.4 / 52.3 ms |
| Open to full-resolution CPU raster (24 / 60 MP, median) | 172.7 / 239.9 ms | 178.1 / 240.7 ms |
| Idle CPU with a 60 MP image open, 30 s after settling | 0.93% of one core | 1.29% of one core |

Registering the Basic module and the histogram adds no measurable launch cost: the medians differ by
38, 45 and 6 ms across the three workloads with five samples each, the p95 differences are mixed in
direction, and the empty-shell median moves by more than the 60 MP one, which neither a per-image
cost nor a fixed registration cost could produce. Registration of the built-in modules was measured
at 0.18 ms when the registry was introduced, three orders of magnitude below this spread. Peak RSS is lower after the change at the empty and 24 MP workloads and 8 MiB higher at
60 MP, and identical after sixteen 60 MP loads. Both columns sit far above the 233 / 296 / 412 ms
S0 viewer launch medians in the table above, and above the 231 / 285 / 396 ms an earlier `measure`
run recorded for the RAW-era build; because before and after agree here, that gap belongs to the
host and OS state of this session, not to this change, and those older figures should not be
compared against these.

Idle CPU is the one figure that moved: 0.93% before against 1.29% after, one 30-second sample each
with a 60 MP image open. The companion 24 MP run with a full Basic layer measured 1.46%. These are
single samples, and the 500 ms event poll and the window's own redraws are inside all of them, but
the direction is consistent and the histogram plot is now drawn on each of those redraws.

A follow-up gave the histogram plot's canvas program an `iced::widget::canvas::Cache`, held in the
program's own persistent state and keyed by a version the view derives from the render identity and
the `stale` flag (`crates/luxforge-ui/src/widgets/histogram.rs`,
`crates/luxforge-app/src/view/tools_panel.rs::plot_version`), so a redraw with unchanged bins reuses
the tessellated polygons instead of rebuilding three 256-point fills. Measured again on the same host,
binary SHA-256 `db6ce15c…`, one 30-second sample each: **1.32%** with the 60 MP image open
(`measure --binary target/release/luxforge --output artifacts/idle-after --samples 5`) and **1.38%**
on the 24 MP full-Basic-layer workload (`editor-latency --source fixtures/generated/24mp.jpg --idle
--samples 3 --output artifacts/idle-after-basic`), against 1.29% and 1.46% before the cache. Both are
within a single sample's noise of the unfixed figures, not a resolution. The `histogram` smoke
scenario (`artifacts/idle-histogram`) confirms the cached plot still renders and updates correctly.
The likely dominant cost is not this widget: even a `SyncResult::Unchanged` reply to the 500 ms sync
still drives two `Editor::update` calls and two full `view()` rebuilds of every panel every half
second (`crates/luxforge-app/src/app/mod.rs`, `app/tasks.rs`), and re-tessellating three small
polygons twice a second could not plausibly account for the whole 0.3–0.5 point regression on its
own. That path has since been removed: the event sync reads the log only when the owner wakes it
for another client's change ([performance rule 8](../engineering/performance-rules.md#rules)). This is a
measurement to attribute, not a resolved regression, and it is reported as a miss below.

### Instant previews: proxy phase, hop rule and the surface primitive

Native Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.5.2, Metal, a 2880 × 1800 physical window at 2× scale, release
builds, background hidden-window launches, warm filesystem cache, one-minute load averages between
4 and 7.5 on a shared host. Application SHA-256 `16423973…`. These rows supersede the
slider-to-presented-frame and queue-cancellation tables above, which measured the full-resolution
render-and-upload path that no longer exists at Fit; the histogram, memory and launch rows above
still describe the current build unless restated here. Presented now means the update in which the
frame became the photo surface's source; it is drawn by the redraw that update requests, the next
frame, and it is still not scanout. The exposure gesture is the same drained drag as above; a full
Basic layer means `--basic`, which commits all ten fields non-neutral first so every frame runs
every colour unit of the module.

| Drained drag, input to presented frame (p50 / p95 ms, 30 samples) | Fit |
| --- | --- |
| 24 MP, exposure only | 9.5 / 29.0 |
| 24 MP, full Basic layer | 18.1 / 24.8 |
| 60 MP, exposure only | 10.1 / 19.1 |
| 60 MP, full Basic layer | 17.2 / 28.9 |
| 24 MP, 7° crop-fit and full Basic layer | 16.1 / 28.7 |

The figures no longer depend on the source size, because every frame in a drag is the proxy phase:
a 1716 × 1144 render of the whole recipe against the cached display-bounded proxy of the source
(the photo area of this window at 2×), presented through the surface primitive with no allocation
round trip. Before this work the same 24 MP drag measured 71.8 / 83.2 ms on this host, 60 MP
132.5 / 151.2 and the crop stack 116.0 / 127.6, all exposure only.

| Wild drag, 120 inputs per second for 3 s alternating direction (`--mode burst`) | Presented fps | Staleness p50 / p95 ms | Largest gap ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP, exposure only | 53.7 | 18.1 / 32.9 | 41.8 |
| 24 MP, full Basic layer | 41.7 | 32.9 / 34.1 | 36.1 |
| 60 MP, full Basic layer | 42.5 | 32.7 / 34.1 | 32.4 |

Every one of the 360 scripted values reaches the owner as its own `draft.set` (the gesture's
round trip is synchronous and takes 0.18 / 0.19 ms), the queue keeps one proxy job active and one
pending, and every superseded exact phase is cancelled (160, 124 and 124 of them in the three runs).
Before this work the same burst presented one frame in three seconds: every render finished after
a newer job had been requested and was dropped as stale.

| Settled exact histogram after the last input (p50 / p95 ms) | Figure |
| --- | --- |
| 24 MP, exposure only, commit mode, 30 samples | 60.1 / 70.3 |
| 24 MP, exposure only, drag mode, 2 commits | 54.3 / 54.3 |
| 24 MP, full Basic layer, 2 commits | 153.8 / 158.6 |
| 60 MP, full Basic layer, 2 commits | 356.4 / 367.0 |

The settled histogram is the exact phase of the committed frame: the full-resolution render with
every unit, then the reduction. It is not on the input path, so a drag does not wait for it; the
60 MP full-Basic figure misses the 200 ms threshold that was set for 24 MP and is recorded here
because the design asks for the tails.

Where the per-input time went before the last two changes, measured with the per-leg timings the
`slider_draft_preview` event now records: the owner's `draft.set` and preview-job work take under
0.2 ms, the desktop's update, model derivation and view under 0.15 ms together, and every message
handed back into the update loop through the runtime arrived about 7.9 ms later, one frame of the
120 Hz display, because a redraw is always in flight during a drag. With the round trip as a task
and the frame through an image allocation, a 24 MP drag measured 38.6 / 63.0 ms; with the round
trip synchronous, 30.2 / 58.7; with the surface primitive, the rows above.

| Core diagnostic, 24 MP crop stack (p50 / p95 ms, 10 samples) | Full resolution | Proxy for 2880 × 1800 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same stack without colour | 29.1 / 32.9 | 16.9 / 19.0 |
| One +1 EV Basic layer | 35.8 / 37.5 | 21.1 / 23.0 |
| Full Basic layer | 77.3 / 79.7 | 46.9 / 48.0 |
| Proxy build (a cache miss: once per source, bounds and window size) | — | 21.2 / 25.7 |

When these rows were taken the proxy source for this stack was the whole 4677 × 3118 proxy stage,
larger than the 2879 × 1618 output it produces, because the 16:9 crop discards most of the rotated
stage; the colour pass covers only the band of rows the crop reads, which is what brought the
full-Basic rows down from 162.5 and 99.8 ms in the first measurement of this plan. A cropped
stack's proxy source is now only the window of the proxy stage its crop reads (below), so these
rows are an upper bound for the current build. The full-Basic proxy render remains the largest
per-input cost and is listed in the
[performance rules](../engineering/performance-rules.md#known-remaining-costs).

#### A tight crop's windowed proxy

A tight crop fits a small output into the bounds, which raises the proxy scale towards one; the
proxy now holds only the window of that proxy stage the crop reads
([instant previews](../design/instant-preview.md#render-what-the-display-can-show)). Measured on
the X100VI with a 1801 × 1574 crop of its 7728 × 5152 stage, in the 1716 × 1576 bounds of a
default hidden window, then Presence committed at Clarity 30, Dehaze 20, Texture 20 and then Clarity
60: one evidence-script launch per run of each release binary from a background-only bundle with
an isolated catalog, RSS sampled every 50 ms by an ad hoc script that is not a committed harness;
times are from the run's own `script_step`, `preview_displayed` and `analysis_adopted` events. Native Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.5.2, runs back to back and
reversed (before, after, after, before), one-minute load average 23.5–28.2 throughout with other
sessions building; single launches, not distributions. Application SHA-256 `a2f1d98d…` before and
`ca82c5b9…` after.

| Per run (before 1, before 2 · after 1, after 2) | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proxy source, crop alone | 7363 × 4909 | 1716 × 1500 |
| Proxy source under Presence | 7363 × 4909 (414 MiB of planes) | 2437 × 2530 (71 MiB) |
| Crop commit, request to first frame | 151, 134 ms | 43, 119 ms |
| First Presence commit, request to proxy frame | 8961, 8338 ms | 1888, 2097 ms |
| First Presence commit, request to settled report | 18203, 17147 ms | 11116, 11338 ms |
| Clarity change, request to proxy frame | 8279, 7490 ms | 1289, 1229 ms |
| Clarity change, request to settled report | 17462, 16065 ms | 11129, 10350 ms |
| Sampled peak RSS | 2914, 2914 MiB | 2074, 2072 MiB |

The proxy phase itself (`render_ms`) is 8.3–8.9 s before and 1.2–2.1 s after for the Presence
commits; the first commit after includes the exact stage's one Dehaze reduction, which the proxy
phase now prepares and the exact phase reads from the store. What remains of a commit is the exact
phase: a Presence render over the whole 40 MP stage, which is unchanged and is the 100% view,
histogram and export source. The figures filed with the bug (about 8.7 s per commit and 3.9 GiB
peak) came from another journey; these runs compare one journey before and after, on one host.

RAW, one functional trial per camera through `raw-editor` (the same 13-step journey as the RAW
tables below, so these are single launches and not distributions): request to display of the
exposure step is 10.5 ms on the Z6, 14.6 ms on the X100VI and 15.0 ms on the Air 2S, against
133.3, 178.8 and the Air 2S figures recorded below for the full-resolution path; rotate, crop-fit
and undo present in 18 to 46 ms. The white-balance steps still take 354–364 ms on the Z6 and
1364–1428 ms on the other two, because a committed temperature, tint, gain or neutral pick
redevelops the mosaic on the source worker before its exact frame exists; that is the release cost
listed in the [performance rules](../engineering/performance-rules.md#known-remaining-costs).

A drafted RAW temperature or tint previews approximately on the developed planes
([instant previews](../design/instant-preview.md#a-raw-white-balance-during-a-drag)), so its drag
has a frame per input like exposure's. `editor-latency`, drained drag of 30 inputs at Fit, same
M4 Pro host (macOS 26.5.2, release build, warm cache), input to presented frame p50 / p95: Z6
temperature 11.2 / 21.0 ms (load average 2.4–4.1) and tint 10.9 / 19.3 ms (2.9–6.1), X100VI
temperature 10.5 / 20.6 ms (6.7–7.0) and tint 13.6 / 20.4 ms (5.2–6.2), against RAW exposure at
12.0 / 19.9 ms on the Z6 (6.1–6.7) and 11.9 / 21.3 ms on the X100VI (5.8–6.6). Every drafted value
produced a frame labelled approximate and none was analysed. The release still waits for the
redevelopment: release to the committed frame is 534–540 ms on the Z6 and 1578–1639 ms on the
X100VI in those runs (two commits each), and in `--mode commit`, 30 commits per run with other
agents building, 376 / 430 ms p50 / p95 for Z6 temperature at load average 11–13 (436 / 465 ms at
23), 441 / 1458 ms for Z6 tint at 23–28 and 1516 / 3175 ms for X100VI temperature (15 commits, load
average 20–22), against 34.5 / 120.8 ms for RAW exposure on the Z6 at 11–13. A wild drag (`--mode
burst`, 360 values over 3 s) presents 43.2 frames per second with a staleness of 16.5 / 34.7 ms
p50 / p95 on the Z6 temperature slider and 35.7 at 16.6 / 30.6 ms on the X100VI's, against 48.8 at
16.7 / 40.2 ms for RAW exposure on the Z6 (load average 5.9–7.4); an earlier RAW exposure burst on
the Z6 presented 45.0 at 16.3 / 37.4 ms, against 51.0 and 16.8 / 30.4 ms for Basic's Exposure on
the same file in the run after it, both at load average 13.

Memory and idle from the same timing tier, five launches per workload: sampled peak RSS 130.4 MiB
empty, 389.7 MiB at 24 MP and 808.8 MiB at 60 MP (medians); idle CPU 1.53% of one core over 30 s
with the 60 MP image open, a miss of the 1% target in the same range as the 1.29–1.46% recorded
before this work, with the histogram and the surface primitive both drawn on each redraw and the
500 ms sync still in place; no timer was added and none remains for previews or gestures.

### Native viewport-region qualification

The current release executable is SHA-256
`888c0313049c7c590311b6dfba4fd60edd40b0c39e780c1147ae24561b5ba998`. Native
qualification uses the Apple M4 Pro, Metal and hidden background launches on generated 24 MP
(6000 × 4000) and 60 MP (10000 × 6000) JPEGs. A presented frame is a correlated
`preview_displayed` adoption, not display scanout. Photo-surface write counters measure uploads
issued during draw encoding; backend-owned staging remains unmeasured. The final timing commands
ran serially after functional work. Their host's one-minute load is recorded at each command's
start and end; a result starting above 8.0 is a loaded-host diagnostic, not a clean baseline.
Case JSON and command loads are retained locally under `artifacts/review-fixes/`, including
`final-timing-runs.json`; the native scenario results are under `rendered-qualified/` there.

The permanent `viewport-region`, `viewport-fallback` and `viewport-idle-fit` scenarios exercise
state, event, pixel and GPU invariants over a generated 24 MP JPEG. All three passed on this
executable in the native rendered tier, which passed 33 smoke scenarios. Each recorded zero blank
photo draws and zero stale photo draws. Peak photo residency was 182,255,616 bytes in the region
journey and 150,994,944 bytes in each fallback and idle-Fit journey. The idle-Fit capture became
ready without another input and reported expected full version 5 drawn as version 5, with two
drawn frames from the view change to its idle deadline, before capture was allowed. Zero blank
draws means each attempted photo draw showed some photograph pixels; it does not prove that every
canvas pixel was covered. The focused Metal surface tests drive actual `write`, `write_region`,
`prepare`, `draw` and readback: all three Appendix A blank-photo regressions pass, bucketed
single- and multi-tile readbacks match, stale overlays are suppressed,
and a deferred photo becomes current after retirement without another user input. The final focused
surface run passed 31 tests; its two ignored retirement timing diagnostics were run separately
after functional work. The current full-photo bound permits a current and retiring allocation up to
512 MiB each, plus two region sets up to 32 MiB each; the full-slot increase is an unaccepted owner budget
proposal. Crop-stage GPU textures and backend staging sit outside that photo accounting.

The final 24/60 MP Fit exposure drags each had 30 inputs in one release launch. Input to presented
adoption was 8.34 / 8.95 ms p50 / p95 at 24 MP and 8.57 / 8.80 ms at 60 MP. The runs started at
one-minute load 7.72 and 7.34, respectively. These are exposure-only journeys, not matched
before/after comparisons with the full-Basic Fit pairs below.

Final 100% and 200% bursts scripted 360 inputs over three seconds. The values below count
`preview_displayed` adoptions, which can outnumber actual screen scans. Every burst recorded zero
blank and zero stale photo draws, but all three started above the 8.0 load threshold:

| Burst | Adoptions | Draft staleness p50 / p95 ms | Adoption gap p50 / p95 ms | Load at start → end |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 24 MP, 100%, full Basic | 331 (330 regions + one whole) | 8.64 / 25.69 (329 samples) | 8.43 / 17.33 (328) | 10.51 → 9.75 |
| 60 MP, 100%, full Basic | 359 (358 regions + one whole) | 8.49 / 16.77 (357) | 8.31 / 9.65 (356) | 9.75 → 10.25 |
| 60 MP, 200%, masked 7° crop and moving pan | 158 (157 regions + one whole) | 25.66 / 34.47 (153) | 17.19 / 25.60 (152) | 10.25 → 9.75 |

The final held viewport journeys each adopted seven region frames and then a whole-image exact
report. They are individual journeys, not latency distributions. Each had zero blank photo draws;
the four or five stale draws are the explicitly marked coherent fallback while a replacement is
pending. No settled pan added a photo write. Each started above load 8.0:

| Journey | First region after input | Stale draws | Peak sampled process RSS | Photo writes across settled pan |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 60 MP full Basic, mask, 7° crop at 100% | 26.00 ms | 5 | 1394.7 MiB | 16 → 16 |
| 60 MP Dehaze at 100%, cold estimate | 863.91 ms | 4 | 1681.2 MiB | 14 → 14 |
| Nikon Z6 RAW exposure at 100% | 17.70 ms | 4 | 1077.8 MiB | 13 → 13 |
| Fujifilm X100VI RAW exposure at 200% | 8.93 ms | 4 | 1616.9 MiB | 13 → 13 |
| DJI Air 2S RAW exposure at 100% | 8.73 ms | 4 | 1044.8 MiB | 13 → 13 |

The cold Dehaze first region includes its exact whole-stage estimate and is still the visible
outlier. Sampled process RSS includes other editor and capture work and is not the photo-texture
charge or a separate GPU allocation measure. A final `measure --samples 1` run recorded one
cold-launch peak RSS
of 379.9 MiB at 24 MP, 636.1 MiB at 60 MP and 912.2 MiB after sixteen 60 MP loads. These are
single launches, not memory distributions. Its 60 MP idle window used 1.421% of one core over
30.26 seconds with the Performance section open, missing the provisional <1% target. That is one
window, not a p95 or an idle distribution.

The two ignored Metal retirement diagnostics ran after functional work. On the pre-fix test
executable, an empty render-thread submit waited 57.075 ms during a 63.103 ms GPU workload,
against a 25.542 µs
control submit; the diagnostic failed as expected. On the final source, the same probe passed:
5.125 µs with one retirement in flight during a 63.389 ms workload. Fifteen smaller retired
workloads produced submit waits of roughly 0.905–3.560 ms before and 2.167–25.667 µs after.
Each trial asserted a real retiring texture. These are timing diagnostics on a shared host, not a
CI timing threshold.

The final 24 MP `editor-performance` pair used 30 samples per build. The 10° crop stack's 200
transforms were 29.65 / 32.96 ms p50 / p95 before and 29.54 / 33.79 ms after; the full-Basic
colour stack was 68.72 / 73.25 → 70.39 / 77.63 ms. On the final 60 MP build, those workloads
were 69.49 / 75.26 and 166.91 / 176.39 ms. The 24 MP legs started at loads 2.15 and 5.46;
the 60 MP leg started at 6.93 and ended at 10.51. The changes do not establish a core speedup.

The older matched Fit comparisons are retained to show the with-and-without-deferral measurement
required for TASK-010. They were one release launch per condition with 30 scripted inputs on a shared
host and predate the current surface changes. Values are input-to-adoption p50 / p95 milliseconds:

| Journey | Before deferral | After deferral |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 24 MP Fit drag | 10.49 / 14.38 | 8.59 / 8.86 |
| 60 MP Fit drag | 15.34 / 17.86 | 8.56 / 8.75 |
| 60 MP Fit masked paint | 10.17 / 17.04 | 8.16 / 11.17 |

The same pairs recorded **slower** release-to-settled-histogram times: 24 MP 32.48 / 35.42 →
33.23 / 62.72 ms and 60 MP 48.40 / 51.83 → 62.03 / 73.00 ms (p50 / p95; only two releases per
condition, loaded host). These are diagnostics, not a stable release distribution. The older 24 MP
`editor-performance` after run also started at one-minute load 8.43, above the 8.0 threshold; its
10° crop stack measured 31.94 / 39.17 → 28.93 / 34.49 ms p50 / p95 over 30 samples per build,
under that loaded-host caveat. Earlier native crop-window evidence recorded a 451 × 418 requested
intermediate; the committed 1000 × 800 fixture proves bounded materialization, and the prior core
window run counted 14 passed and one ignored test. These older figures do not qualify this build.

The RAW white-balance gate remains an owner question. On this final executable, the original
moving-frame criterion passes for the Nikon Z6 and Fujifilm X100VI but fails for the DJI Air 2S:
the release residuals are 2.42%, 3.69% and 17.33%, respectively, against the unchanged 10%
limit. A proposed one-second held-frame comparison produces 0.81%, 1.39% and 5.06%, respectively,
with the draft still labelled approximate. The held-frame criterion has not been accepted by the
owner. Neither comparison defines a general numerical photo-error bound.

### Provisional targets: measured

These provisional targets mostly retain earlier Fit and editor-wide workload evidence; the final
single-window idle result is updated below. They document those checks only; the viewport
half-detail path, shared quiet timer and exact-estimate costs are qualified separately above. A
miss is a finding for the owner's review, not a blocker.

| Provisional target | Measured | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Warm 24 MP slider-to-presented-frame p95 below 16 ms, acceptable below 32 ms | 29.0 ms p95 (9.5 p50, 30 samples); 24.8 ms p95 with a full Basic layer | **Acceptable** (measured against the earlier 100 ms threshold; below the 32 ms bound, not the 16 ms target) |
| Instant preview: drained drag p95 ≤ 33 ms at Fit, 24 and 60 MP, full Basic layer, with and without a 7° crop | 24.8, 28.9 and 28.7 ms p95 (30 samples each) | **Pass** |
| Instant preview: burst drag ≥ 30 presented frames per second | 53.7 (exposure), 41.7 and 42.5 (full Basic, 24 and 60 MP) | **Pass** |
| Instant preview: burst staleness p95 ≤ 50 ms | 32.9, 34.1 and 34.1 ms | **Pass** |
| Instant preview: RAW exposure step presented within 50 ms | Drained drag, `editor-latency --action set-raw-exposure --parameter ev`, 30 inputs each: 12.5 / 23.7 ms p50 / p95 on the Z6 (load average 15) and 16.2 / 24.5 ms on the X100VI (load average 43–52), against 12.1 / 31.0 ms for Basic's Exposure on the same Z6 (load average 15–17); earlier single trials 10.5 / 14.6 / 15.0 ms on the Z6 / X100VI / Air 2S | **Pass** (every run above the 8.0 load threshold, so the figures are upper bounds) |
| Settled exact histogram p95 below 200 ms after the final input, 24 MP | 70.3 ms p95 (60.1 p50, 30 samples) exposure only; 158.6 ms with a full Basic layer (2 commits) | **Pass** |
| Scratch aggregate at most 64 MiB | 13.46 MiB high-water at 24 MP, 12.82 MiB at 60 MP | **Pass** |
| 24 MP single-image edit working set ≤ 600 MiB CPU-resident | 645.3 MiB peak in the process that commits the full Basic layer, which also retains two full-window capture readbacks; 568.2 MiB in a second process holding the same committed layer with no captures, settling to 408.0 MiB | **Miss by 45 MiB** on the capturing process, **pass** on the same stack without the harness's captures |
| 60 MP peak ≤ 1 GiB process RSS | Final single launches sampled 636.1 MiB on one 60 MP open and 912.2 MiB after sixteen loads; the earlier five-launch run measured 975.0 MiB median on one open and 1316.4 MiB after sixteen loads | **Pass in the final single trials; prior repeated-load distribution missed**. One current launch does not retire the prior multi-run finding |
| Idle CPU < 1% of one core over 30 s | Final single 60 MP idle window: 1.421% over 30.26 s with the default-open Performance section | **Miss** (one window, not a distribution) |

| A masked drag costs a person no more than an unmasked one | 24 MP drained drag p50 16.77 / 17.13 ms masked against 16.93 unmasked, 60 MP 17.06 / 17.87 against 17.00 / 17.48, all with a full Basic layer, in both orders at load 2.3–8.1; masked Clarity at 24 MP 17.18 / 17.10 against 17.00 / 17.10 unmasked | **Pass**: every masked run is within 0.4 ms of its unmasked pair at the median, which is inside the spread between two runs of the same condition |

The same two targets at 60 MP, which have no stated threshold and are recorded because the design
asks for the tails: slider-to-presented-frame 125.0 / 141.3 ms and settled histogram 185.4 /
208.8 ms. On the 24 MP crop stack, 150.3 / 170.2 ms and 184.7 / 213.3 ms. The 24 MP crop stack misses
the 100 ms interaction threshold by a wide margin and the largest single contributor is the
`draft.set` round trip, which replans the crop prefix on every set; the 60 MP miss is the
full-resolution render and upload, which is the already-recorded open cost of uploading every preview
at full resolution.

Crop correctness evidence is rendered, not timed: the `crop` and `crop-draft` smoke scenarios record
correlated state, events and pixel checks, and no latency is claimed from them.

The `verify` timing tier reports these provisional targets itself: its summary lists each target
above that `editor-latency` and `measure` can answer, with the measured figure, the sample count, the
exact JSON path it came from and a `pass`, `acceptable` (past the target but inside its acceptable bound), `miss` or `not_measured` verdict, next to the one-minute
load average of the host at the time. A verdict produced from those commands' default sample counts
is a functional check that the targets are still roughly where this table says, not a baseline: a
figure recorded here needs the sample count its own row states, on an otherwise quiet machine. A
summary row or verdict marked `unreliable`, meaning the one-minute load average exceeded 8.0 when its
component started, is never quoted as a baseline or as a pass or a miss.

Core figures exclude desktop scheduling, GPU upload and presentation. Reproduce with
`editor-performance`, `editor-latency` and `measure` as described in
[development](../engineering/development.md). Reports under `artifacts/final-perf-24`,
`artifacts/final-perf-60`, `artifacts/final-latency-24-drag`, `artifacts/final-latency-24-commit`,
`artifacts/final-latency-24-crop`, `artifacts/final-latency-24-crop-commit`,
`artifacts/final-latency-60-drag`, `artifacts/final-latency-60-commit`, `artifacts/final-measure` and
`artifacts/before-measure` retain every sample, the correlated state and the source and binary
hashes; they are local evidence and are not repository assets.

Current macOS `measure` and `editor-latency` runs use background-only bundles to preserve desktop focus, and the editor they launch creates its window invisible. Launch-to-frame timings include copying the executable and creating its temporary bundle; they are background renderer measurements, not foreground activation measurements, and they exclude the cost of placing and compositing a visible window. Nothing in these runs is scanned out, so the presentation figures cover the editor's path to a renderer texture and not what reaching a display would add. Rendering, readback and the state each frame is correlated against are unchanged: the window owns the same Metal surface either way. Reports identify the launch mode. Earlier launch baselines above predate this wrapper and are not directly comparable.

## Current RAW and JPEG measurements

Native Apple M4 Pro, 48 GiB RAM, macOS 26.5.2 (25F84), Metal, 2× scale and a
2880×1800 physical window; files on the internal 2 TB APFS SSD. Release builds,
background-only launches, warm filesystem cache without an OS cache purge. The
RAW application SHA-256 is `ff9eecabdbb3ceaa333885db6bdadb93d86870bfa766a4b95eef13437efa2ea1`;
Cargo.lock SHA-256 is `0c6a739afc2d4830c73059ea2989814950b7607877c59ba945bb89038ea8bd7c`.
The native adapter configuration is recorded in the [backend selection](../research/raw-backend-selection.md).

Thirty complete trials per owner camera passed. Each trial has an isolated catalog,
13 edit/history/view steps, per-step captures and a second-process reopen. The
owner's Z6 is 14-bit lossless NEF; the X100VI is 14-bit uncompressed RAF. All four
public minimum modes also pass one complete trial each; those are functional
checks, not latency distributions. Original hashes, displayed entry/snapshot,
controls, geometry and reopened photo samples are checked together.

Times below are nearest-rank p50 / p95 in milliseconds. Upload readiness is the
application event correlated with the next captured frame, not GPU scanout. Initial
open timings stop at the CPU raster; history and view rows explicitly include
capture readback. Launch-wrapper time and fine-grained stage attribution are not
included in those open figures.

| Measurement (ms, p50 / p95) | Z6 | X100VI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial open → full-resolution CPU raster | 840.0 / 868.2 | 1828.6 / 1887.0 |

| Red WB gain → upload readiness | 488.5 / 508.4 | 1529.3 / 1625.6 |
| Custom temperature → upload readiness | 482.8 / 493.2 | 1532.1 / 1583.6 |
| Custom tint → upload readiness | 483.9 / 501.2 | 1529.0 / 1575.7 |
| Neutral pick → upload readiness | 483.2 / 501.6 | 1528.9 / 1570.0 |
| Rotate → upload readiness | 118.4 / 126.4 | 234.4 / 243.1 |
| Crop → upload readiness | 98.2 / 119.4 | 128.2 / 141.6 |
| Undo → upload readiness | 116.3 / 124.0 | 231.7 / 240.0 |
| Historical Original → captured frame | 507.5 / 524.8 | 1558.7 / 1600.5 |
| Return current → captured frame | 491.3 / 500.5 | 1615.8 / 1666.4 |
| 100% view → captured frame | 24.9 / 25.5 | 25.2 / 25.8 |
| Edited catalog reopen → CPU raster | 1170.2 / 1222.2 | 3267.8 / 3383.2 |

Sampled first-process peak RSS (roughly 50 ms sampling) is 1323 / 1339 MiB p50 / p95
for Z6 and 1975 / 1992 MiB for Fuji. Fuji trial 25 has an unexplained 2436 MiB peak
and a 1038 ms crop update (1007 ms source-to-raster); both tails are retained. Its
pixel, state and reopen checks pass. The capture-heavy workflow cannot isolate
CPU heap, native allocator retention, GPU resources or readback buffers. Separate
screenshot-free live API runs peak at 1583–1647 MiB; the 24-edit run grows only
1.25 MiB after edit three. This does not establish a whole-process bound or prove
absence of leaks. GPU allocations are not measured separately.

Initial development and warm exposure p95 meet their provisional investigation
targets on these files; Fuji memory exceeds the 1536 MiB target. Current WB redevelopment measurements are in
[startup and RAW throughput](#startup-and-raw-throughput). The next resource work is to attribute
the unexplained tail and native/GPU/readback lifetimes, then evaluate bounded
Fit/detail rendering while preserving full-resolution 100% inspection. Budgets
remain provisional; full idle-CPU, cancellation and per-stage measurements remain
open.

The unchanged JPEG core diagnostic was run before and after this integration,
30 samples per recipe and size on the same host with warm filesystem cache.
These exclude desktop scheduling, GPU upload and presentation. Values are p50 /
p95 milliseconds; medians are similar or lower, with mixed tail variation. The
24 MP composed-transform p95 increases by about 1 ms in this run; this is not a
statistical claim of zero regression.

| JPEG core render | 24 MP baseline | 24 MP current | 60 MP baseline | 60 MP current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One exact transform | 10.43 / 11.22 | 10.45 / 11.42 | 23.27 / 32.26 | 22.01 / 28.84 |
| 200 actions in one orientation layer | 10.33 / 10.81 | 10.52 / 11.80 | 23.45 / 25.16 | 22.14 / 23.35 |
| Same stack plus 10° crop | 32.22 / 36.37 | 32.18 / 34.35 | 73.72 / 98.62 | 71.09 / 77.79 |

Reproduce with `raw-editor --samples 30` and `editor-performance --samples 30`
through xtask, using the manifest formats in [development](../engineering/development.md).
Local reports retain every trial, percentile input, source/binary hash and failure;
private photographs and captures are not repository assets. These observations
qualify the recorded files and host, not other camera modes or platforms.

## Air 2S DNG measurements

The supplied FC3411 uncompressed DNG passes 30 complete background editor trials,
each with the same 13-step editing/history/view journey and second-process reopen.
Original hashes, correction provenance, geometry, displayed state and sampled
photo pixels agree. These are native M4 Pro measurements under the configuration
above, with a warm filesystem on a shared host; host isolation is not claimed.
The release application SHA-256 is `aa24dfa57592c5b3363c34ac2c49b9d28827aa2aa0f77fbf34fce6a2db863e55`; Cargo.lock SHA-256 is `e1f96098ab03786e8976afd4e0ed78b0ed3d4c58cd071c032390552c97b4a600`.

| Measurement (ms) | p50 | p95 | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Initial open → full-resolution CPU raster | 1692.6 | 1811.9 | 1812.3 |

Sampled first-process peak RSS is 1245.3 / 1250.5 MiB p50 / p95,
with a 1258.8 MiB maximum; reopened processes measure
718.6 / 731.3 MiB with a 731.4 MiB maximum. Sampling is
roughly every 50 ms. The optical pass adds one reusable 76.15 MiB active-plane
scratch after native demosaic scratch is released; the allocation ledger is in the
[Air 2S design](../design/air2s-dng.md#allocation-and-performance-review).
The captures, GPU resources and allocator retention are included in observed
process memory, not separated. These values do not establish a process-wide bound,
GPU-memory budget or native Windows/Linux result. The existing Fuji resource
qualification above remains open.

The same JPEG core diagnostic was measured before this change at `3c5def1` and
on this DNG implementation, 30 samples per size/recipe. Values are p50 / p95 ms;
these exclude desktop scheduling, GPU upload and presentation. Both 24 MP current
runs are retained because the first showed higher timings. The repeat's medians
fell below baseline, while crop tails remained higher; 60 MP medians and p95 fell.
The mixed observations do not establish a systematic regression or zero regression
on this shared host. No JPEG raster loop, allocation or desktop message changed.

| JPEG core render | 24 MP before | 24 MP current | 24 MP repeat | 60 MP before | 60 MP current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One exact transform | 12.30 / 17.37 | 14.88 / 18.02 | 10.83 / 12.76 | 26.11 / 39.25 | 22.11 / 28.61 |
| 200 actions in one orientation layer | 12.09 / 13.71 | 13.88 / 19.21 | 10.51 / 11.49 | 26.48 / 32.65 | 22.01 / 23.56 |
| Same stack plus 10° crop | 37.59 / 43.42 | 44.80 / 51.38 | 32.25 / 52.32 | 84.71 / 91.98 | 74.96 / 88.99 |

The 60 MP current crop has a retained 129.46 ms maximum. Reproduce with
`raw-editor --samples 30` and `editor-performance --samples 30` as above. Local
reports under `artifacts/air2s-editor-30-01/` and `artifacts/air2s-jpeg-*/`
retain every sample, source hash and correlated state; private originals and
captures are excluded from source control. Single-trial Nikon/Fujifilm editor
regressions also pass, separately from the timing distributions.
The host package passes one complete DNG journey with binary SHA-256
`a13a54b0ce2d9c2bf8d7043897988898894931955dfe0a960620623967a2489c`;
its bundled native notices are present and runtime linkage uses no system RAW library.
This is an unsigned macOS development package, not a license audit or platform qualification.

## UI components qualification

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), macOS 26.5.2 (25F84), Metal, internal APFS SSD,
release `--locked`, warm filesystem cache. Desktop captures are 2880 × 1800 at 2×;
the gallery is 2880 × 2000. Baseline commit `86dfa8438b5930ed9736d5bf03fad59ca3c98a8d`,
binary `573cee81b613b5e70351afadb98265899a51aa655f796f5483e4edc0fa585d18`;
qualified application binary `c630aa038041fe73c63358726a9dcd95d20afb0392da14b13b79a50e5cd4e35a`.
The lockfile hash remains `e1f96098ab03786e8976afd4e0ed78b0ed3d4c58cd071c032390552c97b4a600`.
All launches use the background bundle. Matched measurements run sequentially with this task's
compilation and tests stopped; the shared host is not claimed to be quiescent.

The 6000 × 4000 JPEG drag workload uses 30 drained inputs, one release and a coalesced burst.
Input-to-frame ends at the renderer's `Uploaded` callback, not display scanout. The curve is
visible and its module supplies the sampled polyline; its proof effect preserves photo pixels,
so this measures the gesture, draft, preview and upload path, not a future Tone Curve processor.

| Input-to-frame (ms) | p50 | p95 | Maximum | p95 < 100 ms (the threshold then) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic slider before | 75.00 | 91.10 | 92.40 | Pass |
| Basic slider after | 70.66 | 87.75 | 91.82 | Pass |
| Curve point drag | 57.09 | 74.76 | 108.17 | Pass |

The matched slider pair shows no regression. The initial native baseline under concurrent RAW
verification measured 223.68 ms p95 and **missed** the target; it is retained, not substituted into
the matched comparison. An initial sandbox launch could not access macOS services. The initial
curve timing failed strict decimal-value correlation despite ordered rendered inputs; the accepted
run uses exactly representable fractions and keeps the same strict request/frame checks.

Core diagnostics use 30 samples per recipe at 24 and 60 MP and exclude desktop scheduling,
GPU upload and presentation. Values are p50 / p95 ms. Identity rendering remains below 0.01 ms
and shares source pixels; all source hashes remain unchanged.

| Core workload | 24 MP before | 24 MP after | 60 MP before | 60 MP after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One exact transform | 11.35 / 12.90 | 10.59 / 12.21 | 23.74 / 27.13 | 23.70 / 26.78 |
| 200 actions in one orientation layer | 12.09 / 14.62 | 10.82 / 11.56 | 22.04 / 24.96 | 23.28 / 26.25 |
| Same stack plus 10° crop | 38.21 / 42.93 | 33.45 / 37.10 | 71.87 / 78.17 | 70.66 / 111.85 |
| Exposure on the crop stack | 51.76 / 55.80 | 53.67 / 61.29 | 115.60 / 118.76 | 116.01 / 122.20 |
| Exposure and five Tone fields | 94.26 / 112.15 | 91.08 / 156.10 | 206.06 / 219.86 | 204.94 / 222.84 |
| Vibrance and saturation | 120.02 / 249.29 | 132.22 / 227.33 | 284.31 / 301.14 | 284.65 / 298.20 |
| White balance | 62.41 / 76.42 | 60.39 / 64.29 | 133.80 / 145.05 | 135.06 / 140.08 |
| Histogram reduction | 7.09 / 7.78 | 6.70 / 7.96 | 15.28 / 18.38 | 17.29 / 19.70 |
| Neutral query (25 point samples) | 0.02 / 0.03 | 0.02 / 0.03 | 0.02 / 0.03 | 0.02 / 0.03 |

These core observations are mixed: the 24 MP Tone and 60 MP crop tails increase, while several
other timings fall. No JPEG raster loop changed; these samples do not establish a general
speedup or zero core regression on the shared host. The complete samples, hashes, captures,
state and logs are indexed by `artifacts/ui-components-verification/summary.json`, including
`ui-components-before-matched`, `ui-components-after-slider`, `ui-components-after-curve-final`,
`ui-components-{before-core-24-matched,after-core-24,before-core-60-matched,after-core-60}` and
the retained initial attempts. Gallery and controls smoke cover 63 states on 10 pages and
22 interactions respectively. Existing private RAW, manual visual/fixture-generation and explicit
measurement tests remain skipped; this qualification makes no native Windows/Linux GPU claim.

## Presence, colour mixer and vignette qualification

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), macOS 26.5.2, Metal, release `--locked`, warm source cache, background bundle launches for every desktop figure; core figures are in-memory synthetic frames rendered by the core alone, warm, with the estimate store warm where a global estimate exists. Every desktop figure ends at the renderer's `Uploaded` callback, not display scanout. All three modules run the same full-resolution draft path Basic runs: nothing approximate, no extra cache and no timer was added to reach any figure, and each miss below is a finding for the owner's review.

### Core cost of the units

`cargo test --release -- --ignored presence_timing` and the spatial primitive's own timing test, p50 / p95 over 10 runs, one operation over a textured frame, with the process's CPU time over each run as a percentage of one core (p50). Working set is one tile's reserved bytes; concurrency is how many tiles the 256 MiB spatial target allows in flight at once when no other evaluation holds any of it. The Presence rows ran on 23 September 2026 at a one-minute load of 9.6 to 13; the box-blur rows are the primitive's own earlier run, whose test unit ignores the scheduling below.

| Stage | Operation | p50 / p95 ms | CPU | Summed halo | Working set | Concurrency | Budget peak |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6000 × 4000 | Texture +100 | 241 / 248 | 896% | 8 px | 14.7 MiB | 14 | 205.8 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | Clarity +100 | 193 / 198 | 1090% | 199 px | 20.2 MiB | 12 | 242.5 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | Dehaze +100 | 128 / 134 | 771% | 67 px | 11.0 MiB | 14 | 154.1 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | All three +100 | 942 / 1004 | 1232% | 274 px | 61.3 MiB | 4 | 245.3 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | Texture +100 | 629 / 656 | 858% | 14 px | 15.2 MiB | 14 | 213.3 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | Clarity +100 | 620 / 644 | 1105% | 327 px | 31.2 MiB | 8 | 249.9 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | Dehaze +100 | 355 / 374 | 713% | 107 px | 13.1 MiB | 14 | 183.5 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | All three +100 | 3999 / 4116 | 1221% | 448 px | 101.1 MiB | 2 | 202.1 MiB |
| 6000 × 4000 | Host box blur r = 137 (test unit, naive) | 2528 / 2694 | not measured | 137 px | 17.1 MiB | 14 | 240.0 MiB |
| 10000 × 6000 | Host box blur r = 224 (test unit, naive) | 14970 / 15074 | not measured | 224 px | 24.1 MiB | 10 | 240.9 MiB |

The three units together cost more than the sum of the singles, and that is the halo, not a hot loop: with a summed halo of 448 px a 512 px tile reads a 1408 px input region, dehaze fills 1194 px and texture 1166 px of it to deliver 512 px, so over the stage dehaze computes 5.2 times its pixels and texture 4.9 times, and the 101 MiB working set holds a batch to two tiles. Each of those tiles now runs its own passes on the pool (`Parallelism::Pool`, see the [architecture](../design/architecture.md#rendering-and-limits)), so the render uses about twelve cores instead of two; on the previous build the same test took 12447 / 12561 ms at 60 MP and 1670 / 1708 ms at 24 MP. Larger tiles would repeat less of the halo, measured below; tiling each unit separately would need an intermediate float frame between units, 687 MiB at 60 MP, over the JPEG frame limit. The vignette's unit alone, single-threaded over 6000 × 4000: 57 ms at amount −50, 505 ms at +50 (the positive branch encodes and decodes each channel), 164 ms at roundness −100.

#### Presence exact renders on the generated JPEGs

The core render of the generated 24 MP and 60 MP JPEGs with one Presence layer at +100 in each field it names, warm source and estimates, the 256 MiB target, timed by an uncommitted release probe that calls `render` as `presence_timing` does and reads the process's CPU time around each render; `presence_timing` above is the committed measurement to repeat. The previous build and this one ran four times alternately — previous, this, this, previous — 5 samples per stack and run, at a one-minute load of 5 to 14; every rendered frame of this build had the same SHA-256 as the previous build's for all five stacks at both sizes. p50 of each run:

| Stack | Previous build | This build | Concurrency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 60 MP, all three | 12758 · 10708 ms, 182 · 192% | 3868 · 3854 ms, 1165 · 1191% | 2 |
| 60 MP, Texture and Clarity | 5605 · 5613 ms, 282 · 280% | 2923 · 2889 ms, 1139 · 1175% | 3 |
| 60 MP, Clarity | 576 · 600 ms | 609 · 636 ms | 8 |
| 24 MP, all three | 1358 · 1414 ms, 371 · 369% | 944 · 929 ms, 1137 · 1166% | 4 |
| 24 MP, Texture and Clarity | 879 · 951 ms | 695 · 682 ms | 5 |

On the previous build the process used at most one core per tile in flight whatever the host's load (182 to 192% for two tiles, at one-minute loads from 5 to 29 across the investigation), which is what the Performance section showed as 135 to 190%; the batches themselves were 93% efficient and the one Dehaze reduction took 6 to 34 ms, so neither was the cause. Where a batch is as wide as the pool (Texture or Dehaze alone) its tiles keep their passes serial, and the two builds agree within 5% in both orders at a target wide enough to make every batch fill the pool. The Clarity row, whose eight-tile batches now spread over the pool, moved by about 5% in either direction across runs. The cost is CPU time: the two runs of this build used 697 and 700 CPU-seconds against 370 and 360 for the previous one over the same renders, because fourteen workers on two tiles' memory-bound passes each run slower and the pool spins between short passes.

Two alternatives were measured and not taken. Raising the spatial target to 4 GiB lets fourteen tiles run at once: all three at 60 MP took 3326 ms at 834% (10 samples, load 10 to 22) but the budget peaked at 1415 MiB, against 202 MiB. Counting only the two plane buffers a tile holds at once would lower the all-three working set from 101.1 to 82.5 MiB, three tiles instead of two. Tiles of 1024 px with pooled passes took 2093 ms for all three at 60 MP and 1616 ms for Texture and Clarity (5 samples, load 8 to 12) with the same bytes on these fixtures and the previous build's CPU time, and are the owner's decision, tracked in the [rendering plan](../../tasks/rendering.json), because a point sample through the layer evaluates the whole tile: 217 ms against 105 ms with all three at 60 MP, on the catalog owner.

### Desktop slider-to-presented-frame

`editor-latency --mode drag` on the generated 24 MP fixture, 30 drained inputs each, through the new `--action` and `--parameter` selector. The Basic exposure figure in the same harness is 74.8 / 83.4 ms.

| Slider (24 MP, p50 / p95 ms) | Input to presented frame | Settled exact histogram | Peak RSS | Verdict (16 ms target, 32 ms bound) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Colour mixer, Red hue | 157.1 / 216.1 (min 137.0, max 342.4) | 280.3 / 287.3 | 1357 MiB | **Miss** |
| Vignette, Amount | 121.6 / 135.3 (min 112.0, max 147.9) | 125.0 / 201.4 | 1352 MiB | **Miss** |
| Presence, Clarity | 211.2 / 227.9 | not measured | 1156 MiB | **Miss** |
| Presence, Texture | 230.1 / 244.6 | not measured | 993 MiB | **Miss** |
| Presence, Dehaze | 157.2 / 178.0 | not measured | 1056 MiB | **Miss** |

The mixer's per-pixel cost is the Oklab conversion (three cube roots each way) that Basic's saturation and vibrance units already pay, now paid a second time for a second unit; the vignette's is the extended encode and decode of every channel in its positive branch and the per-pixel mask. Neither exceeds the per-frame cost of the crop resample the earlier rows record, and both stay well under the 1.5 GiB RSS investigation target. The three Presence sliders missed as the design anticipated when each draft rendered the whole 24 MP stage through a tiled neighbourhood operation. These rows predate the instant-preview merge; since it, a Presence stack at Fit renders through the display-bounded proxy and is marked approximate, and the rows are re-measured below.

### After the instant-preview merge

The same harness on the same fixture after main's instant previews were merged (22 September 2026): at Fit every drafted frame is the display-bounded proxy render, so the input-to-presented figure is the proxy phase, and the exact phase runs behind it for the histogram, the overlays and the 100% view. The Presence frames carry `proxy_approximate: true` in the event log (a spatial layer's neighbourhoods scale with the stage); the mixer and vignette frames are proxy renders that equal the exact recipe at their own scale.

| Slider (24 MP, p50 / p95 ms) | Input to presented proxy frame | Settled exact histogram | Peak RSS | Verdict (16 ms target, 32 ms bound) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Presence, Clarity | 16.7 / 17.3 | 216.1 / 227.8 | 989 MiB | **Acceptable** |
| Presence, Texture | 22.7 / 26.6 | 266.0 / 271.7 | 912 MiB | **Acceptable** |
| Presence, Dehaze | 16.5 / 17.4 | 159.9 / 164.4 | 908 MiB | **Acceptable** |
| Colour mixer, Red hue | 22.2 / 28.3 | 182.5 / 186.3 | 1267 MiB | **Acceptable** |
| Vignette, Amount | 14.9 / 22.9 | 66.5 / 130.1 | 1261 MiB | **Acceptable** |

The settled-histogram column is the exact phase's cost and stays where the full-resolution rows above put it, because that is the same 24 MP render; it no longer stands between an input and the frame on screen. Under the owner's target of 2026-09-22 (16 ms p95, acceptable below 32 ms) every slider of the three modules is inside the acceptable bound and none meets the 16 ms target yet; the Presence rows improved by about a factor of ten over their pre-merge rows. Clarity and Dehaze at 17.3 and 17.4 ms p95 sit just past the target, so the display-bounded proxy render of a spatial layer is the next cost to measure and cut, with the coarser-proxy-while-moving and GPU colour-stage proposals of the [instant-preview design](../design/instant-preview.md#proposals-and-later-work) as the candidates.


Rendered evidence is the `presence`, `mixer` and `vignette` smoke scenarios (15, 8 and 12 correlated frames at Fit and 100% with the module's own controls visible), and the field-patch conformance suite's checks per module through the JSON method table. A reviewer's render of the owner's 14 MP Sapa drone JPEG through the core alone (release, in memory: dehaze 65 ms, clarity 104 ms, texture 127 ms, all three at +50 672 ms) showed Dehaze +60 and +100 lifting the veil and deepening colour plausibly, Clarity +100 adding local contrast without visible halos at fit and at 100%, and Texture +100 sharpening fine detail with the expected crunch; it is a visual check, not a measurement. On a synthetic haze-free flat field Dehaze +100 drives the field toward black, because the dark-channel prior reads a uniform patch darker than the atmosphere as pure veil and the frozen `OMEGA_MAX = 1` removes all of it; the study records this and real photographs, whose windows contain dark pixels, do not show it.

## Brush-heavy recipes across history

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), macOS 26.5.2, Rust 1.94.0, release `--locked`, warm filesystem cache, catalog on the internal APFS SSD. One process per fixture:

```text
LUXFORGE_MASK_GROWTH_SOURCE=fixtures/generated/24mp.jpg /usr/bin/time -l \
  cargo test --release --package luxforge-core --lib measure_mask_growth -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Scope: `luxforge-core`'s own catalog, one stroke per history entry written through the production write path, each stroke captured at 100 positions and decimating to 67–78 stored ones, packed into the densest mask table the declared limits admit. The session is built at the recipe and entry level rather than through `mask.add-stroke`, to isolate the storage write path from command dispatch; the bytes it writes are the bytes the API path will write, because it is the same `insert_entry`. The [stroke-storage table](../design/masking.md#stroke-storage) measures 200 strokes packed 64 to a mask rather than 81, which is the same curve one arrangement less dense: 1.11 MB there against 1.10 MB here.

**Catalog growth is load-independent and is the primary result.** Stored is every entry's JSON plus the content-addressed stroke store; embedded is the same session with each stroke's positions written into its payload instead of its address. The 24 MP and 60 MP fixtures produce identical stored bytes, to the byte, because a stroke is stored in normalized coordinates: the catalog's growth does not depend on the source's pixel dimensions, and only the catalog *file* differs, by a page or two of SQLite allocation.

| Strokes | Stored | Catalog file | Embedded | Factor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | 1.10 MB | 1.42 MB | 20.3 MB | 18.5× |
| 500 | 5.64 MB | 6.32 MB | 126.5 MB | 22.4× |
| 1000 | 20.9 MB | 22.2 MB | 505.3 MB | 24.1× |
| 1809 (the ceiling) | 66.1 MB | 68.3 MB | 1652.4 MB | 25.0× |

Least squares over the 37 sampled counts gives `S(n) = 19.30·n² + 1623·n + 2511` bytes, identical on both fixtures. Doubling the stroke count multiplies the stored bytes by 3.49 at 250 → 500 and 3.71 at 500 → 1000: **the growth is quadratic and nothing here may be described as linear.** The design predicted about 19 MB at 1000 strokes from the 35-byte reference alone; the measured 20.9 MB is that curve plus each entry's own JSON and the mask and component structure the references hang on, so the design's figure is corrected to the measurement. The design's 105 MB at 2400 strokes is withdrawn: 2400 strokes of this length is not a recipe this build will hold.

**Two ceilings, both measured.** Sixteen masks of 8192 stored positions hold 1809 of these strokes and no more (`a_session_of_long_strokes_ends_at_the_masks_per_recipe_ceiling`). Independently of stroke length, the 256 KiB per-recipe serialized mask bound is reached at 7040 stroke references, which is the most any recipe can hold; past it the write is refused with `resource-limit: recipe masks serialize to 264356 bytes; the limit is 262144 serialized mask bytes per recipe` and the catalog is unchanged, proved by its SHA-256 before and after and by reopening to the same current entry and history length (`a_recipe_over_the_serialized_mask_bound_names_it_and_leaves_the_catalog_as_it_was`). No painting session's snapshot therefore carries more than 256 KiB of mask data.

**The hash-chain variant recorded in the design is not needed and stays unbuilt.** A realistic long retouching session of a few hundred strokes costs one to six megabytes; the largest session of usable strokes that can exist costs 66 MB; and the pathological maximum — 7040 single-position strokes, one entry each, every snapshot at the 256 KiB bound — is at most 1.7 GB, which is a bound and not an open end. Nothing measured here asks for a variant that would cost an O(strokes) walk to rebuild a stroke list on every read.

**Reopen and peak memory are timings on a shared host and are provisional.** The one-minute load average was 20.8 to 25.1 during these runs — far above the 8.0 at which a figure stops being quotable as a baseline — so they are reported as a ratio and an order of magnitude, not as a target. Reopen is `EditorService::open` plus `state` over the 1809-stroke catalog, three consecutive rounds, and the spread within each triple was under 0.2 ms, so the numbers are stable *under that load* even though the load makes their absolute level unreliable.

| Fixture | Reopen (3 rounds) | Load | Peak RSS | Peak footprint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP | 14.2 / 14.2 / 14.1 ms | 25.1 | 271 MiB | 266 MiB |
| 60 MP | 21.2 / 21.1 / 21.0 ms | 20.8 | 651 MiB | 647 MiB |

Peak memory is the whole test process, which imports and decodes the fixture. Both processes wrote the identical 66 MB catalog, so the 380 MiB between the two rows is the 36 MP between the two images and nothing else: the history itself is not resident, because entries are written and read one at a time and never held together. Reopen resolves all 1809 stroke references and grows by about 7 ms between the two sizes, which is the source decode and not the store.
### Point samples through a spatial layer

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), release `--locked`, 23 September 2026, on a host shared with other sessions. `render.sample` through the live API of a `develop --background` editor with an isolated catalog and no photograph in its window, at random stage points with the estimate store warm, p50 / p95 over 29 samples after the first. "Before" is the previous build, which built the spatial operation's whole float frame for every RAW sample: the one-minute load moved between 4 and 28 while it was measured, so its p50 range over three runs is given too. "After" ran at load 4 to 5.

| Z6 24 MP · X100VI 40 MP, ms | Before: whole frame | After: one tile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `render.sample`, Clarity +60 | 292 / 619 · 842 / 1451 (p50 292–568 · 499–842) | 20.8 / 22.1 · 19.5 / 19.9 |
| `render.sample`, Clarity +60 Dehaze +30 | 623 / 1194 · 1495 / 3152 (p50 623–1130 · 1353–1966) | 36.0 / 38.9 · 37.9 / 38.7 |
| Another client's `draft.set` while one samples in a loop, p50 (max); idle 0.3 | 402–578 (762) · 504–647 (1236) | 19.9 (22.3) · 19.2 (22.7) |

On the byte path the same sample on the generated 24 MP JPEG costs 11.5 ms with Clarity +60 and 34.0 ms with Dehaze +30 added (p50 of 15).

#### Off the catalog owner

The catalog owner now only plans a sample through a spatial layer, in `O(layers)`, and its point worker evaluates it and answers the caller, so another client's call no longer waits behind it. Native Apple M4 Pro, release `--locked`, 25 September 2026: two loopback clients against a background-only, hidden-window editor with an isolated catalog and no photograph in its window, one sampling random stage points in a loop, the other timing 60 `draft.set` calls on an open Basic draft and 60 `asset.state` calls, 30 to 70 ms apart. "Before" is `a82c36e`, "after" this change; each camera ran before, after, then after, before, back to back, and the two orders were run as two passes. **Provisional:** the one-minute load was 18 to 28 during these runs, far above the 8 at which a figure is compared against anything, because other sessions were building on the host; the p50s are consistent across passes, the maxima are not claims.

| Z6 · X100VI, ms, p50 (max) of 60; runs 1 · 2 | Before | After | Idle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Another client's `draft.set`, Clarity +60 | 18.4 (143) · 14.2 (107) · 11.0 (36) · 14.5 (189) | 0.31 (13) · 0.31 (11) · 0.22 (0.3) · 0.31 (6) | 0.17–0.34 |
| Another client's `draft.set`, Clarity +60 Dehaze +30 | 68.7 (290) · 23.6 (147) · 26.6 (193) · 16.1 (37) | 0.23 (0.7) · 0.32 (4) · 0.24 (0.3) · 0.24 (0.9) | |
| Another client's `asset.state`, Clarity +60 | 26.5 (130) · 19.2 (170) · 0.65 (28) · 9.5 (170) | 0.90 (11) · 0.91 (17) · 0.65 (0.7) · 1.09 (11) | 0.54–1.09 |
| Another client's `asset.state`, Clarity +60 Dehaze +30 | 39.2 (300) · 5.5 (127) · 7.6 (119) · 0.66 (39) | 0.56 (1.1) · 0.90 (4) · 0.66 (0.8) · 0.66 (1.5) | |
| The sampling client's `render.sample` while it runs, Clarity +60 · with Dehaze +30, p50 | 20–33 · 35–118 | 20–38 · 35–53 | |

Samples in the contended window: 101 to 238 per run before, 63 to 189 after (fewer, because the other client's calls no longer lengthen the window). The sample itself costs what it cost on the owner: timed alone, 30 samples in the steadiest runs, 19.7 before against 19.9 ms after on the X100VI with Clarity and 34.7 against 34.8 ms with Dehaze added; the wider ranges above are the host's load, which moved between runs. An `asset.state` before occasionally answered in under a millisecond because it arrived between two samples. An earlier pass with a shorter window (5 to 17 ms apart, load 11 to 16) gave the same picture: `draft.set` p50 10.6 to 31.1 ms before against 0.23 to 0.33 after.

Exactness through the owner is the ignored owner test, run in release with `LUXFORGE_RAW_FIXTURE` set to each private source (`cargo test --release --locked -p luxforge-core --lib a_raw_sample_through_presence_off_the_owner -- --ignored --nocapture`): on the Z6, X100VI and Air 2S, 21 samples per stack including the far corner, answered by the point worker, each equal to the pixel an exact render of the current entry writes there. A background evidence run over the Z6 with the after build (`--evidence-script` with Clarity +60, then Clarity +60 with Dehaze +30 through `api` steps, and five `hover` steps including the far corner) showed every readout in the status bar with no render error, each hover step captured 46 to 69 ms after it was sent.

To repeat on a quiet host, build each commit's release app and copy `target/release/luxforge` aside, then run each copy from a background-only bundle (the plist `develop --background` writes) with `--hidden-window --catalog NEW.sqlite`, and drive it with two loopback clients read from `NEW.live-session.json`: import the RAW with `catalog.import` and `job.adopt`, commit `edit.set-presence` with `{"clarity": 60}` and then `{"clarity": 60, "dehaze": 30}`, and for each stack open a `set-basic` draft, warm three samples, time 30 samples alone, time 60 `draft.set` and 60 `asset.state` idle, then again while the other client samples random points in a loop. Run the builds before, after, after, before for each camera and record `uptime` around every run.

Exactness on the real files is the ignored core test, run in release with `LUXFORGE_RAW_FIXTURE` set to each private source (`cargo test --release -p luxforge-core --lib a_raw_point_sample_through_presence -- --ignored --nocapture`): 41 samples per stack, spread over the stage and including the far corner, each equal to the byte the linear render writes there. It also times both sides, p50 ms:

| Clarity +60 · with Dehaze +30 | Z6 | X100VI | Air 2S |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Point sample | 20.1 · 35.4 | 18.7 · 36.3 | 15.1 · 27.9 |
| The whole spatial frame the previous sample built | 261 · 550 | 460 · 1131 | 191 · 352 |

The tile's input region is pulled serially. On the shared pool its rows halved an idle sample (Z6 Clarity, 10 against 19 ms) but waited behind a render that held the pool: p50 116 ms against 21 ms serially (15 samples, two alternations each, load 6 to 9), time the catalog owner would spend blocked. The first sample of a stack whose estimates are not yet in the store also reduced the whole stage once, which added 23 to 113 ms across the three files. That reduction is paid only for a unit that declares an estimate key: Clarity and Texture never pay it, and a new Dehaze amount prepares from the stored atmospheric light.

A background evidence run over the Z6 (`--evidence-script` with Clarity +60, then Clarity +60 with Dehaze +30 through `api` steps, and five `hover` steps including the far corner pixel) showed every readout in the status bar with no render error, each hover step settling within 75 ms of the one before it.

## Preset import parse

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), macOS 26.5.2, Rust 1.94.0, release `--locked`, in memory, 20 runs each: `cargo test --release --package luxforge-core --lib measure_preset_parse -- --ignored --nocapture`. Each synthetic document is filled to the 1 MiB request limit in the shape that presses one bound, and `inspect_preset` runs detection, parsing, mapping and the report. It reads no file and renders nothing.

| Shape (1 MiB) | p50 / max ms | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XMP, one element with every attribute (48,661) | 0.97 / 0.99 | `resource-limit` from the prescan |
| XMP, 1,999 attributes on one element and a curve | 12.57 / 13.75 | 1 mapped, 1,997 unsupported |
| XMP, 199,000 empty elements | 6.51 / 6.73 | 1 mapped, 1 unsupported |
| XMP, 128 namespaces in scope and a 43,000-point curve | 7.06 / 7.55 | 1 mapped, 1 unsupported |
| XMP, 1,748 nested structures of 40 fields | 12.89 / 13.14 | 1 mapped, 1 unsupported |
| Template, 59,482 unrecognised settings | 11.82 / 12.12 | 1 mapped, 59,482 unsupported |
| Template, one flat curve just under 100,000 values | 5.90 / 6.15 | 1 mapped, 1 unsupported |

The XML parser checks each element's attributes against each other, so its cost grows with the square of an element's attribute count. Before the prescan bounded that work to 2,000,000 comparisons, the first shape took 4.1 s p50 and 7.4 s max. The prescan also bounds nesting, which the parser descends recursively, and namespace declarations, which it scans for every prefix.

## Module capabilities qualification

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), macOS 26.5.2, Metal, release `--locked`, on 23 September 2026, on a host shared with other sessions: the one-minute load average was 3 to 11 during these runs and is given per row. "Before" is `ca8eaef`, the last commit without the framework; "after" is `5f77f58`. No figure here is a p95 claim beyond its stated sample count.

### The framework's own costs

`cargo test --release --locked -p luxforge-core --lib capability_timing -- --ignored --nocapture`, isolated directories, an in-memory secret store and the loopback proof endpoint; load 10.9 at the start.

| Measurement | p50 / p95 | Samples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registration, the eight built-ins | 0.020 / 0.022 ms | 200 |
| Registration, built-ins and the proof module | 0.031 / 0.035 ms | 200 |
| `module.status` owner round trip | 0.013 / 0.023 ms | 30 |
| `module.settings.read` owner round trip | 0.009 / 0.012 ms | 30 |
| `module.activate` to active (the proof reads and checks its palette) | 0.27 / 0.31 ms | 30 |
| Cancel a running activation to `cancelled` (the proof's slow loader checks every ~10 ms) | 10.2 / 15.1 ms | 10 |
| A whole `task.generate-proof-tint`: request to `ready`, including the 64 samples, the file read, the loopback request, the artifact publish and its row | 14.9 / 15.8 ms | 30 |
| … of which publishing one 12-byte artifact (synced, renamed) | 9.1 / 9.9 ms | 30 |
| Cancel a task stalled inside its request to `cancelled` (100 ms read slice) | 84.8 / 89.6 ms | 10 |
| Installed proof resource on disk, `installed.json` included; staging left behind | 448 bytes; none | 1 |

Discovery, registration and catalog reopen start no worker thread and create no directory: `schema.list` and `module.list` against a fresh data root leave it empty, and the owner tests assert that no lane has started and the secret store saw no call. The two lanes block on their channels while idle.

### Editor before and after

`measure` (5 launches per workload, background bundle) and `editor-performance` (24 MP, 30 samples), before and after, run back to back.

| Measurement | Before | After | Load |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Launch to first frame, empty (p50 / p95) | 963 / 1084 ms | 1012 / 1072 ms | 3.2 |
| … of which until the process runs (median of the empty and 24 MP launches) | 419 ms | 465 ms | 3.2 |
| … of which process start to first frame (median) | 597 ms | 589 ms | 3.2 |
| Launch to first frame, 24 MP / 60 MP (p50) | 1022 / 1136 ms | 1081 / 1191 ms | 3.2 |
| Sampled peak RSS, empty / 24 MP / 60 MP (median) | 158 / 419 / 850 MiB | 139 / 392 / 853 MiB | 3.2 |
| Idle CPU over 30 s | 0.53% of one core | 0.50% of one core | 3.2 |
| Executable size | 20.4 MB | 24.8 MB | — |

The whole launch difference is in the part before the process runs, which for these background launches includes copying the executable into a temporary bundle: the executable is 4.3 MB larger (rustls, ring and the platform verifier) and now links Security.framework. Process start to first frame is unchanged. The core `editor-performance` rows (transforms, crop, Basic colour stacks, proxy renders, the histogram and the picker) moved by a few percent in either direction depending on which build ran second while the load rose from 5 to 11.6, so they show no difference attributable to the framework; the render path gained only an early return for stacks without artifacts. The full `verify` tier on `5f77f58` passed every provisional target except the empty-shell launch p95 (1012 ms against 1 s), which the baseline also misses under the same bundle copy.

### Transport on `ureq-proto`

Release builds (`cargo xtask build --release`) of `2f972b0` and of the change moving the transport's HTTP/1.1 onto `ureq-proto`, back to back in one worktree on the M4, 2026-09-24. Size only; nothing was timed.

| Measurement | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executable size | 28,499,744 bytes (28.5 MB) | 28,665,072 bytes (28.7 MB), 161 KiB larger |
| `Cargo.lock` packages | 495 | 499: `ureq-proto`, `http`, `httparse` and `base64` |

The 24.8 MB above is the executable at `5f77f58`; the features added since account for the rest of the difference to 28.5 MB.

## Performance section, activity board and resource counters

Native Apple M4 Pro (14 cores, 48 GiB), macOS 26.5.2, Rust 1.94.0, release builds, 2026-09-23, on a host shared with other sessions: one-minute load averages are given per run. The baseline is commit 9fb1fbb, the tree before this work, built in its own worktree.

| Measurement | Result | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resources.read` in the desktop, cache warm (`declare_gpu_presenter` called, this process's GPU clients cached) | p50 4.2 µs, p95 7.1 µs; 5.2 / 7.8 µs with JSON encoding | 1000 reads, `cargo test --release --locked -p luxforge-core --test resources_cost -- --ignored --nocapture`, load 22 to 30 |
| One full walk of the GPU registry (82 to 84 user clients) | p50 0.31 to 0.35 ms, p95 0.39 to 1.1 ms | 200 walks, `cargo test --release --locked -p luxforge-process --test cost -- --ignored --nocapture`; taken at most every 10 s |
| First read after `declare_gpu_presenter` | 0.6 ms when the Metal device already exists (the desktop), 37.5 ms in a process that has none | One read each |
| `activity.list` / `resources.read` / `session.state` round trip through the headless `luxforge-json` owner, stdio and JSON included | p50 14.8 / 19.5 / 18.8 µs, p95 23.0 / 28.1 / 30.9 µs | 2000 requests each after 50 warm-up, load 12 to 18 |
| Activity `begin` + `finish`, uncontended | p50 83 ns, p95 84 to 125 ns | 100,000 iterations; the timer resolves 42 ns |
| Exposure drag input to presented frame, 24 MP, baseline then this work, then reversed | p50: baseline 14.7 and 16.0 ms, this work 11.1 and 15.4 ms; p95 38.9 (baseline), 44.9, 19.0 (this work) and 35.0 ms (baseline) in run order | `editor-latency --source fixtures/generated/24mp.jpg --samples 30`, one launch each, load 19 to 23. No regression; the p95s follow the host in both builds and set no baseline. The settled histogram read 60 to 68 ms p50 in this work's runs against 93 to 94 ms in the baseline's, in both orders; nothing in this work touches the exact render or its reduction, so that difference is not claimed |
| Idle CPU, 24 MP open, Performance section collapsed / expanded | 0.75% and 0.79% collapsed, 1.37% and 1.08% expanded, of one core, in the order collapsed, expanded, expanded, collapsed | One 24 s window per launch, 2 s after the first scripted step; evidence launches (`--evidence-script` with the section's step and three 10 s waits), so both carry the evidence mode's own 250 ms tick; the expanded runs made 31 reads each and the collapsed runs none; load 11 to 15 |

Expanding the section costs 0.3 to 0.6% of one core, which is one sample a second: two owner calls of a few microseconds each, the state panel's re-derivation and the window's redraw. Collapsed it costs nothing. The owner chose that it starts open, so from this change every ordinary launch samples, and the timing tier's idle figure (`measure` holds the 60 MP image in an ordinary launch) includes the open section: expect it 0.3 to 0.6% of one core above the figures recorded before.

## Isolated rendering kernels

The Presence scalar accessor is inlined, RAW terminal conversion reuses the existing sRGB
code-boundary table with the original forward conversion within `1e-12` linear of a boundary,
and Basic's skin-hue weighting uses its bounded atan2 input directly without periodic normalization.
These changes preserve tile geometry, filter arithmetic, scratch targets, scheduling and image
semantics. The boundary fallback retains the previous forward rounding in the native exactness
checks; cross-platform numerical qualification remains open.

Native M4 Pro, 14 cores, 48 GiB, macOS 26.5.2, Rust 1.94.0 release, generated 6000 × 4000
and 10000 × 6000 inputs. Each isolated candidate and retained baseline ran in before/after/after/before order,
15 samples per leg, 30 per variant and size, with one warm-up per process. These are complete
core renders, including the output allocation, from already-prepared data; JPEG decoding,
RAW decoding/demosaicing, proxy creation, histogram reduction and desktop presentation are
outside the timed region. The RAW workload converts the generated JPEG into planar linear
floats before timing and applies source exposure +0.7 EV; it is not an authentic RAW development
latency measurement. The baseline source is `22c4e90`.

| Workload | Baseline p50 / p95 | Optimized p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP, Texture +100, Clarity +100, Dehaze +100 | 815.8 / 877.9 ms | 664.1 / 791.1 ms | 151.7 ms, 18.6% |
| 60 MP, Texture +100, Clarity +100, Dehaze +100 | 3688.8 / 3791.9 ms | 2877.7 / 2927.0 ms | 811.2 ms, 22.0% |
| 24 MP, prepared linear image, source exposure +0.7 EV | 68.0 / 70.9 ms | 57.7 / 62.4 ms | 10.3 ms, 15.1% |
| 60 MP, prepared linear image, source exposure +0.7 EV | 173.8 / 185.4 ms | 146.2 / 152.2 ms | 27.6 ms, 15.9% |
| 24 MP, full Basic | 121.7 / 143.6 ms | 119.0 / 129.7 ms | 2.7 ms, 2.2% |
| 60 MP, full Basic | 304.7 / 315.6 ms | 296.0 / 318.6 ms | 8.6 ms, 2.8% |
| 24 MP, Vibrance +50 / Saturation +20 | 87.4 / 93.9 ms | 84.6 / 88.2 ms | 2.8 ms, 3.2% |
| 60 MP, Vibrance +50 / Saturation +20 | 222.9 / 234.1 ms | 214.7 / 237.3 ms | 8.1 ms, 3.7% |
| 2700 × 1800 proxy from 24 MP, full Basic | 26.1 / 27.4 ms | 25.3 / 29.3 ms | 0.9 ms, 3.3% |

Every Presence and RAW candidate leg beats both baseline legs for its workload; Basic's median
improves in each paired order, including the proxy. Basic's 60 MP and proxy p95 values are slightly
worse, so only a median improvement is established there. Full Basic uses all ten non-neutral
fields of `editor-performance`'s full Basic layer, without its geometry tail in these kernel runs.
Agents' builds and tests were paused during timing. One-minute load was 5.0–8.0 (strictly below
8 at each leg's start) for Basic, 7.0–9.4 for RAW and 12.2–15.2 for Presence, including
the benchmark itself; the Presence results and some RAW legs exceed the harness's 8.0 load
threshold. They establish a relative improvement on this live host, not a new absolute latency
budget or a passed responsiveness target. Presence's 60 MP median CPU time per leg falls from
43.6 CPU-seconds to 33.3–33.4 CPU-seconds, so the wall-time gain also reduces total CPU work.

Complete before/after RGBA buffers match byte for byte for Presence at both sizes, prepared
linear exposure at both sizes, a full Basic layer over a 24 MP linear image, and Basic/vibrance
at both JPEG sizes plus the full Basic proxy. Independent
filter, tile, masked sample/render and quantization-boundary references supplement these
photo-sized comparisons. The unchanged 512 px tile still incurs the halo amplification and
point-sampling cost described above. The current [Markesteijn row executor](../design/native-demosaic-parallelism.md) preserves tile
equations and bounds scratch without adding another thread pool; its measurements are
separate in [startup and RAW throughput](#startup-and-raw-throughput).

The combined source also passes release `editor-performance` against the retained baseline on
both source sizes, again 15 samples per leg in ABBA order, 30 per variant. This official diagnostic
includes its composed transforms and 10° crop, so these values are separate from the bare kernel
rows above. Full Basic at 24 MP is essentially flat (0.4% median reduction); at 60 MP it saves
3.5%. Vibrance/Saturation saves 3.3% and 2.0%. Untouched median rows vary by up to about 3%, so
smaller shifts are not attributed to an optimization. All original-source hash checks pass.
One-minute load at the start of a leg ranges from 4.99 to 15.87; these are live-host comparisons,
not new absolute budgets.

| Integrated `editor-performance` workload | Baseline p50 / p95 | Integrated p50 / p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP source, Full Basic + geometry | 83.0 / 89.7 ms | 82.7 / 88.6 ms |
| 24 MP source, Vibrance/Saturation + geometry | 68.1 / 73.7 ms | 65.8 / 69.4 ms |
| 24 MP source, Full Basic proxy + geometry | 51.0 / 53.2 ms | 49.6 / 52.4 ms |
| 60 MP source, Full Basic + geometry | 202.2 / 277.9 ms | 195.1 / 202.8 ms |
| 60 MP source, Vibrance/Saturation + geometry | 160.8 / 192.2 ms | 157.7 / 161.3 ms |
| 60 MP source, Full Basic proxy + geometry | 53.9 / 58.7 ms | 53.4 / 58.3 ms |

Integrated `verify --tier full --manifest ...` passes all 38 components: workspace/API checks,
30 rendered scenarios, RAW references, three editor/reopen trials each on the supplied Nikon,
Fujifilm and DJI originals, and the timing journeys. Its default timing runs started at load
9.86–11.20, so their absolute target verdicts are **unreliable**, not passed. The existing native
Presence sample/render test also passes explicitly on all three originals, for 41 points including
the far corner through each of Clarity and Clarity plus Dehaze. Those test times are not a new
latency distribution.

The local evidence is under `artifacts/performance-first-wave/`; the implementation and
performance review checklist are in [isolated rendering performance](../design/isolated-performance.md).

## Source preparation and exact rendering

The source worker develops a cold known RAW directly at the validated requested white balance.
Bayer mosaic normalization batches 16 rows through the shared pool above one megapixel; X-Trans
normalization remains serial. DNG optical corrections share the process pool across disjoint rows.
Markesteijn and RCD use the bounded tile jobs described in [startup and RAW throughput](#startup-and-raw-throughput).
Texture and Clarity skip unused global reductions; Dehaze reuses its atmosphere across strength edits.
Its cache distinguishes upstream masks and sampling, source development/view, exposure and approximate
white balance. Terminal encoding indexes the exact code boundaries, retaining the RAW boundary guard;
source-only RAW rendering resolves the planar view once per row. Clipping reduces display grids into
one output allocation, with at most 4 MiB of fixed partial scratch for tiny grids that would otherwise
underfill the pool. The [implementation contract](../design/performance-second-wave.md) contains the
resource and correctness checklist.

Native M4 Pro, 14 cores, 48 GiB, macOS 26.5.2, Rust 1.94.0, release with locked pins,
25 September 2026. Baseline production source `3890a5b`; integrated source `75cca64`.
All agent builds/tests were paused during timing. Each reported distribution combines 15 observations
per leg in before/after/after/before order: 30 per variant, with no tails removed. Kernel leg-start
one-minute load was 10.2–16.9, including the benchmarks themselves, above the harness's 8.0 threshold.
These are relative live-host comparisons, not passed absolute latency budgets. Raw observations,
commands, hashes and load are retained locally in `artifacts/performance-second-wave/`.

### Prepared rendering and native DNG development

Core render times include output allocation/drop and exclude source preparation, histogram reduction,
queue delay and presentation. Generated JPEGs are 6000 × 4000 and 10000 × 6000. The prepared linear
workload converts those JPEG pixels into planar floats before timing and applies +0.7 EV; it does not
measure camera decoding. Full Basic uses ten non-neutral fields; Mixer uses red hue +30, orange
saturation +20 and blue luminance −30. The proxy is 2700 × 1800, prepared outside timing.
Only the Air 2S row develops an actual retained native mosaic, including required optical corrections;
it excludes file read/unpack. Gains overlap and must not be added.

| Workload | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Air 2S, native retained-mosaic development | 1318.3 / 1325.3 ms | 350.3 / 360.9 ms | 73.4% |
| 24 MP prepared linear, source exposure | 60.1 / 63.0 ms | 21.4 / 23.9 ms | 64.3% |
| 60 MP prepared linear, source exposure | 162.6 / 178.5 ms | 58.3 / 60.9 ms | 64.2% |
| 24 MP full Basic | 123.3 / 145.7 ms | 110.8 / 120.3 ms | 10.1% |
| 60 MP full Basic | 325.6 / 371.3 ms | 277.6 / 284.8 ms | 14.7% |
| 24 MP Mixer | 129.5 / 134.5 ms | 112.0 / 136.6 ms | 13.5% |
| 60 MP Mixer | 311.9 / 320.4 ms | 268.2 / 275.7 ms | 14.0% |
| 24 MP source, full Basic proxy | 26.6 / 30.6 ms | 22.8 / 24.8 ms | 14.4% |

Every full RGBA hash and the complete native planar-float hash matches before/after. The 24 MP
Mixer p95 is slightly worse despite its median gain; no tail improvement is claimed there. Serial/pool
DNG tests preserve every float bit, stage/channel order, active-area borders, failures and cancellation.
A separate ten-observation threshold diagnostic gives median 56.7 / 6.8 ms serial/pool at one megapixel
and 170.3 / 19.5 ms at three megapixels for synthetic gain/warp/vignette; inputs below one megapixel
remain serial. This small diagnostic is threshold feedback, not a p95 distribution.

### Spatial amount edits and clipping

A spatial row is one public point sample, including its bounded tile, immediately after changing only
the named strength from 60 to 61 on an already-sampled recipe. Linear inputs are prepared from JPEGs.
Texture/Clarity need no reduction even on the first sample; Dehaze still builds an atmosphere on a cold
cache or changed input. These savings do not remove the tile, which the owner's point worker evaluates.

| Workload | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP JPEG, Clarity | 27.2 / 28.5 ms | 12.6 / 12.9 ms | 53.5% |
| 24 MP JPEG, Dehaze | 19.5 / 20.6 ms | 5.7 / 6.0 ms | 70.7% |
| 24 MP linear, Clarity | 40.3 / 42.8 ms | 14.7 / 15.0 ms | 63.5% |
| 24 MP linear, Dehaze | 32.2 / 34.3 ms | 6.8 / 7.1 ms | 78.8% |
| 60 MP JPEG, Clarity | 53.8 / 57.0 ms | 19.1 / 19.6 ms | 64.5% |
| 60 MP JPEG, Dehaze | 43.0 / 48.2 ms | 7.0 / 7.3 ms | 83.7% |
| 60 MP linear, Clarity | 86.0 / 89.2 ms | 22.5 / 22.9 ms | 73.8% |
| 60 MP linear, Dehaze | 72.7 / 76.2 ms | 8.4 / 9.5 ms | 88.5% |

The clipping rows include reduction and output allocation, excluding decode, painting, upload and
queueing. Every cell matches the retained baseline. A 4096 × 2458 grid holds 9.6 MiB; it is no longer
replicated per parallel fold. Tiny grids remain essentially flat (within 0.2 ms in these medians).

| Workload | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP → 1716 × 1144 grid | 30.5 / 36.3 ms | 1.9 / 2.8 ms | 93.8% |
| 60 MP → 1716 × 1030 grid | 30.9 / 36.6 ms | 4.3 / 4.5 ms | 86.1% |
| 60 MP → 4096 × 2458 capped grid | 276.8 / 319.0 ms | 4.3 / 4.8 ms | 98.4% |
| 60 MP → 1 × 1 grid | 4.4 / 4.8 ms | 4.4 / 4.6 ms | -0.6% |
| 60 MP → 8 × 8 grid | 4.2 / 4.6 ms | 4.4 / 4.7 ms | -3.8% |

### Integrated editor diagnostic

The official `editor-performance` comparison also uses 30 observations per variant and size in ABBA
order. These recipes include the harness’s composed transforms and 10° crop, so their values are
separate from bare kernels. Source-preservation checks pass. Leg-start load was 7.1–15.4; untouched
geometry/histogram medians move by roughly 0–4%, so smaller shifts are not attributed to a change.

| Workload | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP source, Full Basic + geometry | 80.4 / 93.3 ms | 72.3 / 78.8 ms |
| 24 MP source, Exposure + geometry | 37.8 / 43.3 ms | 31.0 / 33.1 ms |
| 24 MP source, Full Basic proxy + geometry | 48.9 / 50.6 ms | 44.2 / 47.7 ms |
| 24 MP source, Build display-bounded proxy | 22.2 / 28.7 ms | 14.8 / 19.7 ms |
| 60 MP source, Full Basic + geometry | 189.7 / 197.8 ms | 173.8 / 178.9 ms |
| 60 MP source, Exposure + geometry | 89.7 / 94.5 ms | 72.0 / 78.2 ms |
| 60 MP source, Full Basic proxy + geometry | 52.7 / 62.7 ms | 46.5 / 50.7 ms |
| 60 MP source, Build display-bounded proxy | 33.1 / 36.7 ms | 24.4 / 30.0 ms |

### Cold saved-white-balance preparation

Every observation restarts the owner and source cache, with the filesystem cache warm, and opens an
existing catalog whose RAW has a saved custom red gain (1.1 × as-shot). The timer starts immediately
before `catalog.import` and ends when a strict exact-source `PreviewJob` is available, including job
waiting and adoption. Owner startup/catalog open, float hashing, final rendering and desktop
presentation are excluded. Full planar float bits are hashed after **every** observation. Source jobs
fall from two to one in every sample; hashes match for every before/after sample. Leg-start load
was 3.1–14.4.

| Source | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fujifilm X100VI | 2950.1 / 3013.8 ms | 1552.4 / 1605.4 ms | 1397.7 ms, 47.4% |
| DJI Air 2S | 2824.9 / 2859.5 ms | 485.8 / 517.2 ms | 2339.1 ms, 82.8% |

The Air 2S saving combines removal of its redundant development with parallel optical correction;
it must not be added to the isolated development saving above. Native correctness regressions also
cover Nikon Z6, new as-shot import, two distinct custom historical/current WB targets, source and
interpretation mismatch, same-target deduplication, different-target cancellation and a WB edit
while loading. Old gains never satisfy a strict request for the newer edit.

### Native qualification

All 38 verification components have passing evidence: workspace/API checks, 30 rendered scenarios,
RAW numerical references, three actual editor/open/edit/reopen trials per supplied Nikon, Fuji and DJI
file, and timing journeys. The initial full run passed 36 components. Its GPU-counter test read a
cached client list before its measured queue existed and could stop on a bookkeeping increment;
the fixture now warms that queue before a fresh sampler discovers it and waits for the existing
numerical lower bound. The bounds, timeout and allocation checks remain unchanged. The focused test
and final quick tier pass. The other failure was mask-range's draft-frame assertion during the
three-scenario pool: exact draft renders were cancelled by later inputs while pixel/state checks
passed. The isolated scenario passes on the identical production binary, displaying 11 drafted
frames. Original failures and focused reruns are retained in the local evidence, with a combined
`qualification.json`; passing native components were not rerun without a code change.

Final native Presence sample/render tests also pass on all three originals. DJI reopen, Presence and
mask/range captures were visually inspected alongside state and event checks. The full run's standard
timing components started above load 8.0 and their absolute target verdicts remain **unreliable**.
GPU colour and larger tiles remain separate work;
Windows/Linux numerical and native GPU qualification are not established by this M4 evidence.

## Startup and RAW throughput

Initial-source preparation now overlaps platform startup. RAW camera conversion mutates the existing
planes in exact bounded chunks, Bayer normalization uses bounded 16-row batches above one megapixel,
and native Markesteijn and Bayer RCD use bounded tile jobs on the shared pool. X-Trans normalization
remains serial.
See the [implementation contract](../design/performance-third-wave.md) and
[native execution bounds](../design/native-demosaic-parallelism.md). No image equation or output
quantization tolerance changes.

Native M4 Pro, 14 cores, 48 GiB, macOS 26.5.2, Rust 1.94.0, release with locked pins,
25 September 2026. Baseline is main `5d121d7`; matrix/startup observations use `84370ec`,
whose timed matrix and first-proxy implementations are unchanged by the final native scheduler
and evidence-capture fixes. Final native observations and desktop qualification use `2dd1b72`.
The JPEG rendering control uses `59cf51d`; that timed implementation is unchanged. Each comparison
combines 15 observations per leg in before/after/after/before order:
30 per variant, with tails retained. Builds and tests stop during timing. Commands, hashes, load,
raw samples and captures are retained locally in `artifacts/performance-third-wave/`.
Scopes below overlap and their savings must not be added.

### Exact camera conversion

The timer covers camera-to-working-space conversion and adoption validation over actual developed
camera planes. Allocation/clone, file read/decode, native development, hashing and drop are outside
it. The baseline uses the previous scalar expression and public validating constructor; the new
measurement invokes the actual private producer and adoption boundary. Complete float hashes match.

| Camera | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nikon Z6 | 50.73 / 51.66 ms | 3.74 / 4.63 ms | 92.6% |
| Fujifilm X100VI | 84.88 / 86.26 ms | 6.04 / 7.62 ms | 92.9% |
| DJI Air 2S | 42.02 / 42.87 ms | 2.98 / 3.91 ms | 92.9% |

The conversion writes disjoint 65,536-pixel chunks in place, using the shared pool above one
megapixel and serial chunks below. Each output is checked finite at production; private adoption
retains shape/capacity checks without another full scan. Public constructors still scan and reject
invalid input. There is no additional full-frame scratch. Leg-start load was 3.0–5.5.

### First image during startup

These are app-cold, filesystem-warm launches of temporary copied background bundles with a hidden
Metal window. An independent 10 ms event-file observer measures from argument parsing to the first
observed proxy event. This includes event observation delay; it is not scanout, foreground activation
or a stable installed-bundle launch. Ordinary first-preview behavior is unchanged by the later
capture-readiness fix.

| Source | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generated 24 MP JPEG | 806.0 / 828.1 ms | 764.0 / 778.6 ms | 42.0 ms, 5.2% |
| Generated 60 MP JPEG | 876.8 / 912.2 ms | 778.6 / 806.3 ms | 98.2 ms, 11.2% |

The existing authorized import starts before platform initialization and is adopted through the
ordinary open lifecycle; no second source job is created. Empty args-to-observed-capture remains
786.7 / 800.6 ms before and 787.5 / 809.2 ms after. Args-to-editor-startup remains about
578–582 ms. Leg-start load was 4.2–5.9. The initial-open request clock now starts before prequeueing;
old and new `open_to_raster` values therefore have different origins and are not compared.

### Native development and saved-white-balance preparation

Retained-mosaic development includes native output allocation/drop and excludes file read/unpack,
core matrix conversion and rendering. Fuji uses the final tile scheduler; Nikon and DJI native
implementations are unchanged. Complete native reference and before/after warm-output hashes agree.

| Native source | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nikon Z6 | 268.8 / 272.2 ms | 268.6 / 270.7 ms | Essentially unchanged |
| Fujifilm X100VI | 1277.2 / 1282.5 ms | 355.8 / 363.6 ms | 72.1% |
| DJI Air 2S | 351.9 / 368.0 ms | 350.6 / 358.1 ms | Essentially unchanged |

Cold saved-WB preparation restarts the owner and source cache per observation, with the filesystem
warm and the catalog's saved red gain at 1.1 × as-shot. Time runs from `catalog.import` until a
strict exact-source `PreviewJob` is available: read/hash/unpack/develop/matrix/validation and
waiting/adoption are included. Owner startup/catalog open, final float hashing, rendering and
presentation are excluded. Every observation's complete float planes and source identity match;
there is exactly one source job in every before/after sample.

| Source | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 | Median time saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nikon Z6 | 596.3 / 625.2 ms | 546.5 / 584.6 ms | 8.3% |
| Fujifilm X100VI | 1542.1 / 1574.4 ms | 535.9 / 572.8 ms | 65.3% |
| DJI Air 2S | 486.7 / 505.8 ms | 443.0 / 466.2 ms | 9.0% |

The unchanged-camera comparisons ran at load 3.2–6.5; final Fuji comparisons ran at load
2.3–4.3. Fuji development's process CPU median per 15-sample leg increases from
1276–1278 ms to 1512–1517 ms while wall time falls. Peak process RSS from those whole diagnostic
processes increases from 917.3 MB to 933.2–933.4 MB (decimal bytes); this includes preparation and
measurement, not just live demosaic scratch. The faster development uses about 19% more process CPU.

Explicit Markesteijn heap scratch is globally capped at eight × 988,208 bytes, or 7,905,664 bytes,
including the source-caller job. Stack arrays, tables, allocator overhead and full image buffers
are additional. Callback cancellation, native faults, nested callers and teardown are tested;
no partial output is adopted.

### Bayer mosaic normalization

For Bayer sources above one megapixel, native normalization submits 16-row batches to the existing
shared executor before the RCD call. At most eight callbacks are admitted under
the shared cap. Normalization writes the existing mosaic allocation, adds no per-worker scratch,
checks cancellation per row and retains the serial path for X-Trans. Whole normalized mosaics and
RGB planes match bit for bit against the scalar serial oracle on authentic Nikon Z6 and DJI Air 2S
Bayer inputs. Output guards, partial final batches, cancellation and worker-error behavior are
covered by focused tests.

Native M4 Pro, 14 cores, 48 GiB, macOS 26.5.2, release with locked pins, 25 September 2026, with
RCD still serial in both arms. Each camera uses 30 warm observations per arm in 15 ABBA pairs in one
fresh process. The corrected
baseline runs the original scalar normalization, not a serial call through the new row helper.
Timing excludes source read/decode, the DJI correction warp, rendering, GPU work and presentation;
the full serial RGB oracle is retained for comparisons outside each timed call. High-water RSS is
measured for the entire diagnostic process with that oracle alive, and so is not an arm comparison
or normal-editor working set.

| Source | Serial wall p50 / p95 | Batched wall p50 / p95 | Serial normalization p50 / p95 | Batched normalization p50 / p95 | Serial process CPU p50 / p95 | Batched process CPU p50 / p95 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Nikon Z6, 6064 × 4040 | 268.890 / 279.380 ms | 236.979 / 239.121 ms | 39.539 / 40.743 ms | 7.642 / 7.919 ms | 268.841 / 277.505 ms | 289.976 / 292.705 ms |
| DJI Air 2S, 5568 × 3648 | 230.419 / 231.727 ms | 198.162 / 200.328 ms | 39.921 / 40.543 ms | 7.464 / 7.982 ms | 230.411 / 231.661 ms | 248.674 / 252.729 ms |

Standalone retained-development wall p50 falls by 31.91 ms (11.9%) on Z6 and 32.26 ms (14.0%) on
Air 2S; p95 falls by 40.26 and 31.40 ms. Process CPU p50 rises 7.9% on both. Whole-process
high-water RSS is 851.95 MB on Z6 and 698.12 MB on Air 2S with the full serial RGB oracle held;
normalization itself adds zero scratch. One-minute load averages start/end at 7.69/6.79 for Z6 and
6.33/5.29 for Air 2S (the accompanying 5/15 minute values are 4.53/4.49 to 4.49/4.47, and
4.43/4.45 to 4.29/4.40).

A separate same-pool Fit proxy diagnostic uses a 1920 × 1280 proxy and 30 exact-byte-checked
samples per arm while one full Z6 Bayer development runs. Serial/parallel/parallel/serial legs
measure core rendering only; they exclude the app event loop, texture upload and scanout.

| Normalization arm | Fit proxy wall p50 / p95 | Process CPU per 15-proxy window p50 / p95 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Serial | 13.857 / 14.811 ms | 184.232 / 188.143 ms |
| Parallel | 13.881 / 16.155 ms | 179.741 / 191.291 ms |

Median proxy time is flat and p95 rises 1.344 ms. Window CPU includes the exact RAW worker. No exact
development completes during a proxy window; summed post-window join/drain across each arm's two
legs is 186.4 ms wall / 196.1 ms process CPU for serial and 208.6 / 209.2 ms for parallel
normalization. The diagnostic process peaks at 891.5 MB across both arms, including the retained
source, proxy, oracle and transient RGB output; that is not per-arm memory. These measurements
support the bounded implementation for standalone RAW speed, but do not establish app-level
presented-frame latency or source-open savings. Do not add its core savings to the cold saved-WB
results above. Keep the eight-callback cap and requalify full editor contention before changing it.
This contention diagnostic predates RCD's tile jobs, which its parallel arm now also runs; it has not
been repeated since.

### Bayer RCD tile jobs

RCD runs its 194 px tiles as jobs of the same executor as Markesteijn, checking cancellation before
every tile ([native demosaic parallelism](../design/native-demosaic-parallelism.md)). Each job holds
one 978,536-byte scratch set under the shared eight-slot cap. Complete RGB planes match the pre-change
serial digest on the Z6 and Air 2S and the serial raster at every worker count.

Native M4 Pro, 14 cores, release, 26 September 2026, one-minute load 3.2 to 4.1. Each run is the
crate's `bayer_normalization_release_abba_profile`: 30 warm observations per arm in 15 ABBA pairs in
one fresh process. The build before pooled RCD and this build ran back to back and then reversed
(before, after, after, before) per camera. The executor arm is the production path. Timing covers
retained-mosaic development only, as in the table above.

| Source | Build | Wall p50 / p95 | Demosaic p50 / p95 | Process CPU p50 / p95 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Nikon Z6 | before | 237.8 / 240.8, 238.7 / 247.4 ms | 203.8 / 205.9, 204.1 / 212.6 ms | 290.5 / 296.0, 291.7 / 301.2 ms |
| Nikon Z6 | after | 55.9 / 58.3, 56.0 / 62.2 ms | 40.8 / 42.9, 40.8 / 44.9 ms | 301.3 / 307.2, 300.5 / 319.1 ms |
| DJI Air 2S | before | 199.0 / 201.8, 199.2 / 202.7 ms | 168.6 / 171.1, 168.9 / 171.2 ms | 250.1 / 253.7, 249.9 / 253.7 ms |
| DJI Air 2S | after | 44.2 / 45.1, 44.3 / 46.1 ms | 30.7 / 31.0, 30.6 / 31.1 ms | 256.0 / 262.3, 257.4 / 262.6 ms |

Development wall p50 falls by about 77% on both cameras and the demosaic by about 80%, for about 3%
more process CPU. Concurrent Fit proxies against a pooled RCD development are not yet measured. To repeat, run each
build's profile once per camera in the order before, after, after, before:

```sh

  cargo test --release -p luxforge-raw --locked --lib -- --ignored --exact \
  tests::bayer_normalization_release_abba_profile
```

### RAW colour row batching

The production RAW renderer writes its last segment in the row chunks the JPEG colour pass uses
(at most 16 rows and 1 MiB of RGB float per chunk), on the shared Rayon pool above one megapixel,
checking cancellation and reserving the chunk's scratch from the colour budget per chunk. Every
stack evaluates its colour runs over those rows: masks, replacements, exact geometry and the segment
after a resample or a spatial operation as well as a source-only segment. The segments before a
boundary are pulled, never materialized, a bounded rectangle at a time with their colour run over
its rows: a spatial operation's input one row of its tile region at a time, and a straightened
crop's taps one block of 64 output columns by the chunk's rows at a time, through the rectangle of
at most 16,384 pixels those taps read, so each pixel before the resample is evaluated about once
per block instead of once per tap. A segment with a point replacement is pulled pixel by pixel.
Complete-buffer tests compare the rows with the point evaluator for Basic, Mixer and their combined
recipe, a viewed source, a partial final chunk, replacements on either side of a colour run, colour
after a straightened crop at 4 and -30 degrees and after Presence, masked colour and a masked
Presence layer before a crop, on a stage narrower than one tap block and on one several blocks
wide.

The measurements below were taken when only a source-only segment was batched, in eight-row
chunks; they are the evidence for that path. Release core-render comparison on retained real RAW
planes, 30 observations per variant and recipe in 15 ABBA pairs. The reference is the old per-pixel
evaluator with the same parallel scheduling threshold. Timers include output allocation and drop, but exclude file read, decode/development,
desktop scheduling, GPU upload and presentation. Process CPU is cumulative over the shared 14-core
Rayon pool, sampled outside each render timer. No build or test ran with the timed profiles.

| Camera / recipe | Reference wall p50 / p95 | Production wall p50 / p95 | Reference CPU p50 / p95 | Production CPU p50 / p95 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Z6 / Full Basic | 398.3 / 449.0 ms | 146.0 / 155.2 ms | 5217.9 / 5290.4 ms | 1888.0 / 1949.4 ms |
| Z6 / Mixer | 297.0 / 308.9 ms | 167.9 / 175.8 ms | 3866.0 / 3912.6 ms | 2154.4 / 2190.5 ms |
| X100VI / Full Basic | 646.4 / 893.3 ms | 220.2 / 290.1 ms | 7903.9 / 8149.5 ms | 2598.8 / 2738.2 ms |
| X100VI / Mixer | 503.9 / 607.2 ms | 278.0 / 315.2 ms | 5793.8 / 5914.1 ms | 3127.7 / 3236.8 ms |

The first X100VI pass was lower-tailed: Full Basic reference/production p50/p95 618.8/700.3 ms and
201.2/252.7 ms; Mixer 496.8/557.0 ms and 277.1/315.2 ms. Leg-start load was 6.38 for Z6 and 5.39
and 5.80 for the Fuji passes. The renderer drove the shared pool; one-minute load at the end rose to
14.80, 24.37 and 23.82. The table gives the repeat Fuji distributions, including the wider tail.

The production median reduction is 63% on Z6 and 66–68% on X100VI for Full Basic, and 43–44% for
Mixer. These are separate recipe workloads; do not sum their savings into a combined-stack estimate.
Source planes are 294 MB and 491 MB, outputs 97 MB and 159 MB. Row scratch is at most 676 KB and
1.30 MB across 14 folders. Activity Monitor footprint after decode was 556 MB and 925–928 MB; the
reference and production snapshots were about 752 MB and 1.244–1.247 GB, with no material
production increase. Those snapshots are not allocator traces or GPU allocation measurements; the
full-output equality check holds both RGBA outputs together once.

The shared-pool Fit proxy check uses a 1920 × 1280 nearest-sampled proxy from actual Fuji retained
RAW planes and the Full Basic recipe. Thirty proxy requests are measured while one external caller
repeats exact full-source renders; proxy creation, RAW decode, build, desktop work, upload and
presentation are excluded. The generic exact renderer completed 30 full renders and the production
row path completed 29. The process memory footprint after overlap was 1.172 GB for the generic path
and 1.166 GB for production (resident 1.180 GB and 1.175 GB respectively). Process CPU over each
whole overlap window includes both the exact worker and proxy requests.

| Exact render sharing the pool | Proxy alone p50 / p95 | Proxy with exact work p50 / p95 | Overlap wall / process CPU |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Generic per-pixel reference | 13.9 / 26.5 ms | 623.9 / 658.3 ms | 18.8 s / 240.7 CPU s |
| Production row batching | 12.1 / 13.1 ms | 207.2 / 214.7 ms | 6.0 s / 79.9 CPU s |

Production cuts the contended proxy p95 by about 67%, but 215 ms still misses the 32 ms acceptable
input-to-presented-frame limit. A one-row callback experiment measured 213.5/226.2 ms p50/p95 and
30 exact renders in 6.4 seconds, slightly behind the eight-row path's 207.2/214.7 ms and 29 renders
in 6.0 seconds. This measures a continuously active core exact render and a core proxy, not a user's
UI gesture or GPU presentation. The external load at the starts of the two variant legs was 7.86
and 6.98; no build or test ran alongside either. The intentional shared-pool work raised the ending
loads to 8.91 and 9.57. Full scope, scratch accounting and the repeatable diagnostic are
in [further performance opportunities](../research/further-performance.md#raw-colour-row-implementation-and-measurement).

### Shared-pool contention and rendering controls

One retained Fuji development competes with four full-Basic renders of a prepared 1920 × 1280
JPEG proxy. External callers start at a barrier and share Rayon. Each operation clock excludes
preparation, thread creation, hashing and frame drop; the proxy is hashed between requests while
RAW work continues. This is a CPU scheduling diagnostic, not desktop/GPU/presentation latency.
There are 30 development and 120 proxy observations per variant, in the same ABBA order; complete
proxy hashes match. Leg-start load was 2.1–5.2.

| Concurrent operation | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fuji retained-mosaic development | 1292.6 / 1303.8 ms | 367.8 / 379.7 ms |
| Full-Basic JPEG proxy render | 11.69 / 13.28 ms | 11.66 / 14.01 ms |

The throughput gain does not materially move the proxy median; its p95 increases by 0.74 ms.
Earlier schedules were rejected because a preview waiter could steal long native work: draining
row groups gave 216 ms proxy p95, one row per callback still about 64 ms, and a four-worker cap
still about 60 ms. Ordinary pool callbacks now contain at most eight tiles. The dependent final
two rows run on the existing external source caller, with the same global scratch admission and
without holding a permit across a join.

A separate phase sweep starts preview work 0/75/125/175/225/275/325 ms after the RAW barrier,
five trials at each offset and four renders per trial. The seven 20-observation proxy p95 values
range from 12.3 to 17.6 ms; the maximum of all 140 renders is 27.0 ms. This diagnostic checks
later overlap as well as the ordinary early-start case; it is not a 30-sample distribution per
phase or a hard latency guarantee. Load was 2.8–3.4. Nested Rayon callers retain correctness and
liveness coverage, but the latency result applies to the production external source caller.

The official JPEG `editor-performance` diagnostic is a control: this batch changes no JPEG colour
kernel. Its composed geometry/crop and full Basic recipe produces the following 30-observation
results. Source-preservation checks pass. Leg-start load was 3.9–14.2; small shifts in unchanged
code are not attributed to an optimization or used as absolute latency-budget evidence.

| Workload | Before p50 / p95 | After p50 / p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24 MP full Basic + geometry | 78.7 / 88.0 ms | 78.2 / 81.2 ms |
| 60 MP full Basic + geometry | 183.0 / 191.1 ms | 182.5 / 188.9 ms |
| 24 MP source, full Basic proxy + geometry | 47.5 / 52.3 ms | 47.2 / 50.0 ms |
| 60 MP source, full Basic proxy + geometry | 50.0 / 52.0 ms | 49.3 / 53.1 ms |

### Qualification and remaining opportunities

The final full tier passes all 38 functional components: workspace/API checks, 30 background
rendered scenarios, RAW numerical references, nine actual RAW open/edit/reopen journeys and timing
journeys. Independent review covered tile scratch, disjoint writes, FFI lifetime, nested admission,
private validated adoption and capture settlement. Complete native float references, original
hashes and sample/render/history checks pass. Final Fuji and DJI reopened captures were visually
inspected alongside their correlated state and events.

An earlier run exposed an evidence race: a screenshot requested from the temporary 1× proxy could
return after the 2× refit was displayed, making identical recipes appear different on reopen.
Capture readiness now waits for permitted current-bounds refits, preserves intentional draft deferral
and render-error evidence, and retries readbacks superseded by newer photo pixels before publishing
or saving them. Ordinary first-preview presentation is unchanged. Focused draft/refit tests and the
final native journeys pass; the original failure and diagnosis remain in the local evidence.

The final full tier's `editor-latency` and `measure` components started above load 8.0, so their
absolute-budget verdicts remain **unreliable**. The separate comparisons above retain their own
loads, scopes and sample counts. No sanitizer run, Windows/Linux numerical qualification or
cross-platform native GPU qualification is claimed by this M4 evidence.

The remaining candidates are ranked in [further performance opportunities](../research/further-performance.md).
Bayer normalization and RAW colour row batching are in production and measured on actual owner
inputs; their core shared-pool results are separate from presentation and do not replace end-to-end
evidence. RCD runs bounded tile jobs; its quiet-host timing and preview contention remain to be
measured. Startup attribution, GPU texture transfer, GPU
execution and SIMD/assembly remain open; CPU RGBA publication already writes directly into the
frame owner, and no additional savings are assigned to it.

## Method

Optimized builds only, with commit, lockfile, OS, CPU/GPU, RAM, display and storage recorded. Report cold and warm runs separately and say which cold is meant. Keep at least 30 samples and never drop failures or tails silently. Measure user event to presented frame, not shader time, and account CPU RSS, cache bytes, GPU allocations and transient copies without double-counting unified memory. Capture idle after all background work stops. No timing gates in CI; CI enforces exactness, deterministic bounds and coverage. VM checks record hypervisor, guest graphics path and software versus accelerated rendering, and never stand in for native timings.

Correctness checks use deterministic fixtures across all EXIF orientations, gradients, patches and fine detail: coordinate round trips, crop coverage, CPU versus GPU differences and export interpretation, including centered Option resizing and angle sweeps that return without cumulative shrinkage. Color and export proofs choose explicit numerical tolerances and viewing conditions.

## Module activation

Logical boundaries and user enablement do not by themselves reduce memory or launch time. After the first external use case is selected, compare the built-in baseline with an activation prototype on the M4: minimal and default configurations, disabled and enabled-but-unused modules, first use, cold and warm launch, RSS, CPU/GPU allocations, idle work and first-use latency, with packaging size reported separately. Disabled modules must start no workers and allocate no processor resources. Reject any optimization that changes output or skips a recipe effect. If the benefit is immaterial, keep the simpler built-in implementation; the external-loader requirement remains regardless.

## Growth rules

Catalog opening never enumerates or decodes all originals. Grid memory depends on visible items and cache quotas. Import, hashing, thumbnailing and indexing use backpressure and resumable batches. Switching photos cancels obsolete preview requests, and the app stays interactive during exports and indexing. Introduce tiling with neighborhood halos before promising unrestricted large-image local processing. A cleanly reported resource limit is acceptable; silent exhaustion is not.
