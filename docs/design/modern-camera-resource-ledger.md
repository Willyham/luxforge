# Modern camera resource ledger

Status: design and measurement ledger for the modern-camera expansion, applying
the [owner-approved RAW admission contract](architecture.md#rendering-and-limits)
against real camera files. This is an implementation contract, not a
process RSS limit or a broad quality claim. All 100 selected models have
authentic adapter qualification. JPEG limits remain independent and
unchanged.

## Scope and accounting rules

JPEG keeps the existing [architecture](architecture.md#rendering-and-limits) evaluated-frame and
aggregate-scratch limits; RAW uses the same [admission contract](architecture.md#rendering-and-limits).
The standalone raw probe has separate diagnostic checks and must not be used
as evidence that the editor admits a camera mode. A decoder limit is not a
process or GPU limit.

The table uses binary MiB (bytes / 2^20), with one full pixel per sensor
sample. A u16 mosaic is `2 bytes/pixel`; planar RGB float is `3 * 4`
bytes/pixel; the terminal RGBA display buffer is 8-bit `4 bytes/pixel`.

| Work item | 24 MP | 40 MP | 128 MP | Liveness implication |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Encoded RAW source at the approved 512 MiB ceiling | 512 MiB | 512 MiB | 512 MiB | RAW-only admission bound; JPEG limits remain independent. |
| Immutable u16 mosaic | 45.8 MiB | 76.3 MiB | 244.1 MiB | Retained by the source while WB or a source redevelopment is possible. |
| One planar RGB float frame | 274.7 MiB | 457.8 MiB | 1,464.8 MiB | A 128 MP frame is below the approved 1.5 GiB per-buffer bound. |
| One terminal RGBA8 display/upload frame | 91.6 MiB | 152.6 MiB | 488.3 MiB | The terminal buffer is 8-bit; GPU/shared-memory copies still need accounting. |
| Two planar RGB float frames | 549.3 MiB | 915.5 MiB | 2,929.7 MiB | Active plus pending preview, or input plus output at a resample boundary. |
| Mosaic plus two planar RGB frames | 595.1 MiB | 991.8 MiB | 3,173.8 MiB | Does not include native decoder scratch, allocator retention, or GPU/shared-memory copies. |

The 1.5 GiB contract therefore covers one 128 MP planar RGB frame only. It
does not cover the source mosaic, a second visible/pending frame, native
demosaicer scratch, or a display upload. The 512 MiB encoded bound is also
independent of JPEG limits and cannot be adopted by
raising one constant: source bytes, decompressed mosaic, decoder allocations,
float planes, and shared-memory display resources overlap in time.

## Phase liveness

The source worker reads encoded bytes and keeps them alive through signature
validation and decode. After the immutable u16 mosaic is established, the
encoded buffer should be released; the in-memory source cache retains the
mosaic and a developed float result only while references require them. The
serialized recipe/source metadata does not contain the mosaic. A white-balance
change redevelops from the retained mosaic. If the old preview remains visible
while a new preview is being computed, both float results are live. The
documented preview queue is one active job plus one replaceable pending job, so
a pending result must be accounted for even when it will soon be superseded.

At a pixel-stage geometry resample boundary, the architecture permits two full
frames: the prior segment's input and the next segment's output. Ordinary crop
and orientation views share the developed float planes. The display path then
samples into a terminal RGBA buffer. On Apple unified memory, a GPU
texture is still a physical memory cost even when it is not reported as a
separate process allocation; a capture or readback can add another live copy.
The source and float memory gate must therefore wait for actual references,
not just queue state, before admitting another large source.

Native RCD and Markesteijn workspaces are additional to these formulas. The
standalone probe recorded historical peak RSS of approximately 425 MiB for
24 MP Z6 RCD and 707 MiB for 40.2 MP X100VI Markesteijn in
[the probe notes](../../probes/raw/README.md) (those are decoder-stage trials,
not current editor limits). Scratch generally scales with implementation and
working tiles rather than only final pixel count, so a 128 MP value cannot be
extrapolated as a release guarantee. The adapter sets LibRaw's
`max_raw_memory_mb = 512`; that is a LibRaw internal allocation ceiling.
It can reject a large source before Luxforge's own u16/float accounting is
reached, and it does not make a 512 MiB process budget true.

## Authentic baseline measurements

The available current Sony samples were run through the repository's native
`qualify_profiles` develop qualifier. Each sample ran in a fresh process with
source preservation, decode, as-shot development, and perturbed-WB
development. The command shape was:

```text
/usr/bin/time -l target/release/examples/qualify_profiles \
  /private/tmp/sony-ledger-manifest-2418.json /private/tmp/sony2418-qualifier-escalated.json
/usr/bin/time -l target/release/examples/qualify_profiles \
  /private/tmp/sony-ledger-manifest-1313.json /private/tmp/sony1313-qualifier-escalated.json
```

| Sample | Authentic file SHA-256 | Raw dimensions | Pixels | Result | `/usr/bin/time -l` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Sony ILCE-7M3, id 2418 | `ece80551abf64949dbe826985a80f1d9b265401ee4ea6b989e1829549616fdcd` | 6048 × 4024 | 24.34 MP | native develop passed, 1.88 s | 593,395,712 bytes (565.9 MiB) |
| Sony ILCE-7RM2, id 1313 | `fdf3e8deea4ca31c6ee905fe5226efab398ce630ec96e9013850b488ce0e6289` | 8000 × 5320 | 42.56 MP | native develop passed, 3.29 s | 1,030,914,048 bytes (983.1 MiB) |

These are adapter functional measurements, not controlled colour or complete
editor/UI qualification. The `raw-editor` smoke scenario reads mode identities from the camera
catalog and checks the imported DNG geometry and correction provenance; the RAW adapter enforces the
catalog's DNG requirements on import. The
figures include native decode/develop and both WB passes, but not an editor
window, preview replacement, display upload, or reopen path.

## Background editor measurements

The M4 Pro native Metal editor passed three edit/history/reopen trials for ten
representative modern models and the three owner originals (39 trials, 78
background launches). The first process performs exposure, red/blue WB,
temperature/tint, neutral picking, rotation/crop/undo, historical preview and
zoom changes. The second process reopens the committed state and matches the
captured photo pixels. Sources remained unchanged.

The following are sampled first-process peak RSS, with roughly 50 ms sampling,
release binary `82b2f010b105760f8fe156bf3bd74b42e9c9c7069b43ac168af9dff3d559dd03`.
Each row has three trials; filesystem cache was not purged. Captures and GPU
resources contribute to process RSS, and GPU memory is not isolated. These are
observations rather than a hard process ceiling or a timing baseline.

| Source | Median peak MiB | Maximum peak MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| OM System OM-3 | 1268.1 | 1288.2 |
| Sony A7 III | 1426.6 | 1438.5 |
| Canon EOS 5D IV Dual Pixel RAW (primary) | 1558.8 | 1560.9 |
| Fujifilm X-T5 | 1977.7 | 1983.0 |
| DJI Mavic Pro FC220 | 934.2 | 934.9 |
| Owner Fujifilm X100VI | 1945.3 | 2010.2 |

The local correlated state, events and captures are under
`artifacts/modern-camera-full-final/raw-editor/run/`. These photo-sized results
show why the decoder's per-buffer bound cannot be treated as an editor process
budget; even the current 40 MP path reaches approximately 2 GiB in this journey.

The same full verification ran the standard 24/60 MP JPEG performance checks.
The 24 MP slider-to-presented-frame p95 was 83.21 ms (30 samples), settled
histogram p95 106.3 ms (two samples), and scratch high-water mark 13.46 MiB.
Sampled peak RSS medians were 503.4 MiB at 24 MP and 981.2 MiB at 60 MP (five
samples each). Idle CPU was 1.68% of one core over 30 seconds, missing the
provisional <1% target. These default sample counts are functional observations,
not a performance baseline or a RAW memory guarantee. The full summary is
`artifacts/modern-camera-full-final/summary.md`.

## High-resolution editor measurements

The final build (`83243ad47ccf7f5afe7ef9323ab504a9789c26d4ad9a2aa4a4a9b8c537efdaca`)
passed 27 edit/history/reopen trials across these six models and the three owner
originals, three per source, using the
same roughly 50 ms process-RSS sampling and hidden native Metal editor. The
source originals remained unchanged. Filesystem cache was not purged, and GPU
memory was not isolated. Captures and correlated state are under
`artifacts/modern-camera-100-final/raw-editor/run/`.

| Source | Median first-process peak MiB | Maximum peak MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Fujifilm GFX100S | 4277.9 | 4409.9 |
| Sony A7R V | 3298.1 | 3533.5 |
| Canon EOS R5 | 2147.6 | 2152.2 |
| Nikon Z8 | 2268.6 | 2603.7 |
| Leica Q2 | 2321.8 | 2473.0 |
| Leica SL2 | 2351.0 | 2352.8 |

The GFX100S source is 200.4 MiB encoded and has 103.37 million sensor pixels.
One sensor-sized planar RGB float buffer is 1182.9 MiB; its complete editor
journey reached 4.31 GiB sampled peak RSS. Increasing admission permits larger
existing allocations; it does not make a file's encoded size representative of
editor memory. Resolution drives decoded memory, while compression and required
corrections also affect processing time.

The Q2 journey exceeded the old 25-second evidence deadline while still producing
valid correlated frames. Scripted evidence now has a 60-second application
bound and the RAW harness has a 70-second process bound. Its completed first
processes took about 32–33 seconds across the three trials. These whole-journey
measurements include multiple developments and captures; they are not slider
latency measurements or controlled performance baselines.

The complete final verification passed its functional checks, including 19
rendered scenarios and all 27 RAW edit/reopen trials. Its standard JPEG timing
components ran above the host-load threshold (one-minute averages 10.00–10.87,
threshold 8), so their timing verdicts are explicitly unreliable. Observed
slider p95 was 84.48 ms, settled histogram p95 109.9 ms, scratch high-water mark
13.46 MiB, and 24/60 MP median peak RSS 497.4/981.7 MiB. Idle CPU was 1.85%.
These numbers are not performance acceptance or a baseline. The full report is
`artifacts/modern-camera-100-final/summary.md`.

## Modes and measured resource context

These are measured encoded sizes and native sensor dimensions from the selected
CC0 files. Planar bytes are `sensor pixels × 12`. These rows preserve the
measured resource context used when the RAW budget was approved; admission still
requires profile identity, source evidence and mode qualification. A valid matrix
and successful standalone unpack do not establish broad image-quality support.

## Colour and serialization constraints

The public as-shot RGB camera matrix is metadata supplied by the decoder and
is applied after camera-space WB; it is not a brand-specific allocation or
memory shortcut. It may be used for another brand only when that camera's
profile supplies and validates its own matrix, white level, CFA, black sites,
and mode metadata. A matrix from a different camera must never be substituted
because its dimensions happen to match.

In-memory source state retains one shared immutable mosaic and explicit
profile metadata; serialized recipes retain metadata and source identity. Arc sharing and single-flight requests avoid duplicate
copies, but serialized recipes do not prove that old/new previews or GPU
uploads have been released. Memory admission must be based on live buffer
references and measured native/display phases.

## Practical recommendation

Keep JPEG's existing frame and scratch limits. For RAW, use the [approved admission
contract](architecture.md#rendering-and-limits) while qualification
continues. Prefer single-frame modes whose measured liveness fits the available
buffer and worker budgets, release native scratch before display conversion, and enforce one
active plus one pending preview with byte-accounted eviction. Measure complete editor workflows at each supported resolution before making process-memory claims;
128 MP modes remain qualification work. A process-wide 128 MP claim
needs tiling or another bounded representation plus measured RCD/Markesteijn,
display/GPU, and WB replacement liveness; accepting it by increasing the
encoded or float constant alone would undercount the simultaneous peak.
