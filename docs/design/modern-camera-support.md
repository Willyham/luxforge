# Modern camera and drone support

## Scope

Expand the data-driven RAW path to a practical set of 100 widely used modern
camera/drone models across brands, including the three existing models. This is
a coverage selection, not a measured sales ranking. The owner selected broad
usage across brands rather than newest-first coverage and requested Luna
subagents. Maintain exact make/model identities and recording-mode evidence.

## Behavior and constraints

Profiles select bounded processing capabilities; no model-name processing
branches. Source-dependent calibration remains authoritative in each file.
LibRaw's camera list alone is not Luxforge qualification: its published list
assumes optional features which this build may not enable. Unknown modes,
unsupported mandatory corrections and incompatible metadata fail explicitly.
Do not invent full-sensor dimensions from advertised megapixels.

Use a selected subset of CC0 authentic files from raw.pixls.us, with URL,
SHA-256, license and observed decoder metadata recorded. Downloads and rendered
photos stay ignored, bounded and local. Do not mirror the whole corpus. Validate
source preservation, mosaic/float correctness, calibrated dimensions and crop,
then representative background editor/history/reopen workflows. Separate each
mode's demonstrated evidence from outstanding controlled color/scene coverage.

The [owner-approved RAW resource contract](architecture.md#limits) is separate from JPEG, whose limits are unchanged. High-resolution models, container compression, missing crop
metadata, per-green black levels and DNG correction layouts may require shared
capabilities before a profile can be enabled. Never inflate the support count
with guessed entries or bypass required corrections to admit a model.

## Current evidence

The selection contains 100 configured model identities and 103 recording modes,
including the original modes. The authentic adapter evidence covers one selected
recording mode per model: 99 CC0 public sources and the existing owner Air 2S
source. Each qualification checks source hashes before/after, full mosaic
retention, usable calibration, and finite as-shot and perturbed-white-balance
development. Per-source metadata and hashes are in
[the evidence manifest](../../fixtures/modern-camera-evidence.json);
[the selection](../../fixtures/modern-camera-selection.json) records source URLs
and licenses. Float hashes record this build's output; they are not independent
color-reference ground truth.

The high-resolution profiles use the approved RAW-only resource contract in
[the resource ledger](modern-camera-resource-ledger.md). For DNGs whose decoder
reports a trimmed active bottom, a bounded profile value reconciles that exact
delta while preserving the source ActiveArea for correction coordinates. The
SL2 profile records LibRaw's 19-row trim; the full raw mosaic is retained.
A demonstrated mode does not qualify every recording setting or, for drones,
every camera module. The Mavic 3 Pro Cine fixture covers its 4032×3024 module.

The native M4 Pro editor passed 39 edit/history/reopen trials across ten
representative modern models and the three original owner fixtures. The checks
cover temperature/tint, individual channel WB, neutral picking, exposure,
rotation/crop/undo, historical previews and exact reopened displayed pixels.
The final build additionally passed 27 edit/reopen trials across six larger/Leica
models and the three owner originals. Full verification also passed 19 general
rendered scenarios and the independent RAW numerical reference. The resource ledger records sampled process memory
and its limits. Controlled
color/detail, other recording modes, and native Windows/Linux package
qualification remain separate work.

## Reproducing adapter qualification

Download the selected public sources with the bounded
`cargo xtask raw-camera-metadata --index FILE --ids ID[,ID...] --output NEW_DIR`,
passing the raw.pixls.us repository index (`json/getrepository.php?set=all`)
and the selected numeric sample IDs. Pass `--max-source-mib 512` for the
complete selection; its conservative default download cap is 128 MiB. It
verifies the repository's CC0 license and SHA-256, downloads one sample at a
time through `curl` over HTTPS and refuses to reuse an output directory. It then
decodes each file once with the RAW adapter and records its metadata, or the
adapter's refusal (an unrecognised mode names LibRaw's make, model, decoder, bit
depth and size), and hashes it again; a decode alone does not establish
application support. Keep images and generated results in an ignored evidence
directory.

Create a qualifier manifest containing `{"samples": [{"id": "sample-id",
"path": "/absolute/source/path", "sha256": "expected-source-sha256"}]}` for
only the enabled selection entries. The owner fixture needs local access; it
is not downloadable from the public repository. Run:

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -p luxforge-raw --example qualify_profiles -- \
  /path/to/manifest.json /path/to/new-results.json
```

The qualifier runs sources sequentially, refuses an existing output file, and
returns failure if any source changes, metadata is unsupported, or development
fails. Its maximum source read is the RAW adapter's [encoded-source bound](architecture.md#limits). Public
fixture redistributions and source photographs are not committed.

OM-3 calibration comes from the exact model entry in pinned RawSpeed camera
data, with its attribution and data license in the RAW adapter's notices.
Unpacking with LibRaw's identity fallback is insufficient: the adapter rejects
missing or singular XYZ-to-camera calibration before publishing the source.

## Work and acceptance

Luna agents research disjoint model groups and prepare evidence-backed candidate
records. Root owns shared decoder/profile changes, selection integration and
verification. A profile can be marked enabled only with its required processing
implemented and authentic decode/development evidence. Track concrete blocked
modes and missing fixtures; distinguish implementation from broad image-quality
qualification.

The finished catalog has 100 distinct selected model identities, source-grounded
mode rules and capability choices, reproducible qualification evidence, current
support documentation, and passing quick/rendered/timing checks. Full verification
is required before claiming the broad support checkpoint. Existing three-camera
metadata, corrections, source preservation and history remain regressions.

## Coverage and resource scope

- Exact model set follows the agreed broadly used modern mix and available
  decoder evidence; selection must not hide popular high-resolution models simply
  because they require more memory.
- The [approved RAW-specific allocation budget](architecture.md#limits) applies; JPEG limits stay independent. A
  process-wide RSS claim still requires measured editor liveness evidence.

## Performance checklist

- Source reads, hashes, unpacking and development stay on the existing verified
  source worker. Cache hits, retained mosaics and source exposure/WB reuse keep
  the existing source-signature path.
- Sparse sensor repairs add at most 65,536 index/value pairs, shared with the
  source. Their sorted coordinate list is also bounded. List membership uses
  binary search; constant-marker scans are linear in the bounded sensor size.
  No new full RGB copy is introduced. Ordered DNG warps reuse one active-area
  float plane after native demosaic scratch is released, as in the original
  Air 2S path, within the [approved RAW limits](architecture.md#limits); aggregate editor RSS is measured separately and
  high-resolution editor evidence is recorded in the resource ledger.
- The neutral picker checks at most 65,536 sparse replacements and samples its
  fixed patch with binary-search lookup. It does not develop or rasterize a
  frame. No decoding, color conversion or hashing moves onto the catalog owner.
- The only desktop admission change is the set of RAW filename extensions in
  Open. Preview, history, upload and cached source messages retain their existing
  triggers. No timers, polls or subscriptions are added.
- Native and full editor measurements are scoped in the resource ledger and
  verification evidence. These changes make no speedup or process-memory-bound
  claim; loaded-host timings are not a baseline.
- Exact tests compare stage-ordered gains/warps to separate reference stages,
  sparse correction to an undamaged mosaic, and physical green-site calibration
  to an independently calculated result. Existing original-source hashes,
  independent Air 2S numerical samples and editor history/reopen checks remain
  required. Crop/orientation continue sharing the developed float planes.
