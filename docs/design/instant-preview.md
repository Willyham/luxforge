# Instant previews: display-bounded proxy rendering

Status: implemented and verified on the M4 Mac; the measured figures against the targets below are in [performance](../specs/performance.md#instant-previews-proxy-phase-hop-rule-and-the-surface-primitive). It changes how the desktop previews a stack while a gesture is open and how the Fit view is produced; it changes no recipe, history, API mutation or export behaviour, and the exact full-resolution render remains the only source of the histogram, the clipping counters and the 100% view. The measurements that motivated it and the ones that qualify it are in [performance](../specs/performance.md).

## The problem, measured

Every slider input today costs one full-resolution render and one full-resolution GPU upload, bracketed by two 16 ms timers ([performance](../specs/performance.md#desktop-slider-to-presented-frame-and-settled-histogram)):

| Step, 24 MP JPEG at Fit | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Wait for the 16 ms slider tick before `draft.set` is sent | 0 to 16 ms |
| `draft.set` round trip plus the preview job, on the owner | 8 ms (33 ms under a rotated crop, which is CPU contention with the render, not owner work) |
| Full-resolution CPU render: orientation copy, colour pass over 24 MP, crop resample | 15 ms (Exposure alone) to 140 ms (every Basic unit), plus 30 ms for a rotated crop |
| Wait for the 16 ms preview poll after the worker finishes | 0 to 16 ms |
| GPU upload of the 24 MP RGBA raster | 32 ms (50 ms at 60 MP) |

The presented frame lands 75 ms after the input at the median with one unit active, 150 ms under a crop and 125 ms at 60 MP, all before the pointer's own tick wait. A wild drag never sees the newest value on screen: the pipeline keeps at most one job active and one pending, so most inputs are coalesced away and the ones that survive are shown four to nine frames late. The screen shows at most 2880 × 1800 physical pixels, so at Fit at least four of every five rendered and uploaded pixels are discarded by the GPU's minification. RAW is worse: the linear path evaluates every pixel recursively in f64, so a Z6 exposure drag costs 133 ms per frame.

## Goal

A slider dragged back and forth wildly at Fit shows the value under the pointer within two display frames, on the owner's M4 Mac, with every Basic unit active, on 24 MP and 60 MP JPEGs, under a rotated crop, and on the qualified RAW sources for the RAW exposure slider. The slider, RAW exposure, burst and settled-histogram thresholds are the [performance plan's provisional budgets](../specs/performance.md#provisional-budgets), and a miss is reported with its figures; idle CPU and process memory keep their targets, and the proxy adds at most one bounded buffer.

"Presented" keeps its harness meaning: the desktop update in which the rendered raster became the photo surface's source, drawn by the redraw that update requests. It is not scanout.

## Design

### Render what the display can show

A **proxy source** is the prepared source downscaled once to the size the display needs, and a **proxy render** is the whole effective recipe rendered against that proxy source through the existing compiled path. Every layer that can be drafted or committed today is resolution independent: the orientation layer is a mapping, the crop payload is normalized, the Basic layer and the RAW development layer are pointwise. So the recipe compiles unchanged against the smaller content stage and produces the same picture at display size, with the same code and the same colour arithmetic, at a fraction of the cost. Nothing is approximated inside the colour path; the only thing that differs from the full-resolution render is the resampling that the display was going to do anyway. (A drafted RAW white balance is approximated before the proxy is involved, at either scale, and is labelled; see [below](#a-raw-white-balance-during-a-drag).)

- `ProxyBounds { width, height }` are physical pixels: the photo area of the window at its scale factor. The desktop derives them from the window size and the open panels exactly as the clipping overlay's cell grid already does, and sends them with every preview request. The core clamps them to 4096 px per side and 8 megapixels.
- The proxy scale is `s = min(bounds.width / stage.width, bounds.height / stage.height, 1)`, where `stage` is the full-resolution output stage of the recipe, read from the job's one compilation at the exact stage (`O(layers)`, no pixels), which the exact phase and the coverage grid reuse; the proxy phase compiles once more, at the proxy stage, for its frame and its approximation label. The proxy source is the content stage at `round(width × s) × round(height × s)`. When `s == 1` there is no proxy and the exact path runs as today.
- Downscale is an area average (box filter) with fractional coverage, separable, on the shared Rayon pool. JPEG sources average in linear light through the existing decode table and re-quantize through the existing threshold table, so a uniform region is exactly its own code. RAW sources average the planar f32 planes through the image's view, so the proxy is a smaller `LinearImage` with the same fingerprint and an identity view. Without a crop the proxy of a JPEG is at most 64 MiB and of a RAW at most 96 MiB. Each is counted as a frame against the existing 512 MiB frame limit.
- **A cropped stack's proxy holds only the window the crop reads.** A crop's output, not the source, is what is fitted into the bounds, so a tight crop raises the scale towards one: a 1801 × 1574 crop of the X100VI's 7728 × 5152 stage, in 1716 × 1576 bounds, has a 7363 × 4909 *proxy stage*. The recipe is still compiled against that whole proxy stage, so every normalized payload, mask and spatial radius resolves exactly as it would there, but the proxy source is only the rectangle of it the output reads, walked back through the compiled segments (`render::window`), and the compilation is cut to match: the first segment reads the window at its offset, a segment whose output a boundary reads keeps only what that boundary reads, and a resample reads that window with its coordinate translated by the window's integer origin, which is exact in `f64`. The window is built with the same coverage weights as the whole downscale over only the source rows and columns it covers, so its pixels are the whole downscale's, bit for bit. **The stated margin:** a straight crop's window is its output exactly; a straightened crop's is the axis-aligned box its output's bilinear taps read, plus 2 px on each side; and when a spatial layer precedes the crop, the window of the stage it runs over is what the next segment reads grown by the operation's summed halo (within the host's 512 px bound; at most 448 px for Presence) and clamped to the stage, with its origin moved down to the 512 px tile grid (at most 511 px more on the left and top), so the operation's own tiles are the stage's. The proxy source is therefore bounded by the display bounds and those margins whatever the crop's tightness: that X100VI crop's proxy is 1716 × 1500 (29 MiB of planes) alone and 2437 × 2530 (71 MiB) under Presence, against 414 MiB for the whole proxy stage. A proxy stage the output reads all of, or a stack that cannot be cut, keeps the whole-stage proxy: a finish-stage layer (whose units read the coordinates they are handed) or a point replacement in a segment that would be cut, a spatial layer with a global estimate behind another spatial layer, or a proxy-stage compilation whose segments differ from the exact one's.
- **A spatial layer under a window.** A spatial operation runs over its window as its own stage. Its units are tile invariant over tiles anchored at the stage origin, and the window's origin is on that grid, so every pixel the crop reads is the value the whole proxy stage gives it; its mask is compiled against the whole stage and read at the window's offset. What the window cannot hold is the whole-stage reduction a global estimate (Dehaze's atmosphere) is prepared from, so the operation is handed the estimate the **exact** phase of the same job resolves for the exact stage: prepared once per estimate identity on the proxy phase, kept in the store, and read from there by the exact phase, so the job reduces the stage once, as before. A windowed spatial proxy frame is thus byte for byte the whole proxy stage rendered with the exact stage's estimates, which is part of the approximation its `approximate` label already reports.
- One proxy source is cached by the preview worker, keyed by the source identity (fingerprint, and for RAW the process-unique number of the developed planes, so a white-balance redevelopment invalidates it even when its planes reuse the old allocation's address), the proxy dimensions, the bounds and the window. A job that changes any other layer under the same crop therefore hits the window already built, and a crop that moves or changes size builds the window it now reads, once. A crop drag itself never builds one: its draft previews the crop layer's input stage, a truncated job with no proxy phase, and the window is built by the first full job after the drag. The cache holds pixels only: a RAW hit takes the developed planes from the cache and the development settings from the job that is rendering, so a drafted exposure renders against the cached planes. The worker owns the cache outright: it decides each job's proxy phase (eligibility and the `O(layers)` plan), builds the source on a miss and keeps it, so none of that runs on the desktop or the owner thread. The bounds are decided on the desktop thread at the moment a job is requested, so a job queued after the display scale is known is already at it; an open requested at launch, before the window reports its scale, renders at a scale of one and is refitted once when the scale arrives (20–40 ms later on the owner's Mac). A resize, a panel toggle or the display scale arriving re-renders the proxy on screen once, coalesced by the queue, and never during a gesture or a crop draft.
- Eligibility is decided by the registry: a recipe is proxy-eligible when every layer's effect is at the source, colour, spatial, geometry or finish stage. A pixel-stage layer (the point-replacement proof module, whose coordinates are content pixels) makes the stack ineligible and the job takes the exact path, as does any compile failure at the proxy size. Ineligibility is reported in the result and the desktop's state summary, never silently. A spatial-stage layer (Presence) is eligible but approximate: its neighbourhoods scale with the stage they are rendered at, so its proxy frame is close to the exact render at display size rather than the same picture, and the result, the `preview_displayed` event and the state summary say `proxy_approximate` or `approximate` when a frame was rendered that way. The label is read from what the stack compiles to at the proxy size, not from the stages its effects declare: a neutral or reset Presence layer compiles to no spatial operation, so its frame is the exact recipe at proxy size and is not labelled. The exact phase still produces every number and the 100% view, so the trade is a Fit preview that follows the drag at display cost against one that costs a full-resolution neighbourhood pass per input. A **mask** changes neither answer: its geometry is normalized, so a masked layer is eligible at whatever stage it is compiled against and its proxy frame is the exact recipe at proxy size. The one exception is a mask drawing a feature narrower than two proxy pixels, which the proxy phase evaluates with a 2 × 2 supersample of the mask field — never the effect — and reports approximate through the same word, with a reason beside it that names which of the two made the frame approximate ([masking](masking.md#point-queries-and-proxies)).


### Two phases per job

A preview job at Fit produces two results under one generation:

1. **Proxy phase.** The worker takes the cached proxy source (or builds it), renders the recipe against it and sends the proxy raster, with the mask overlay's coverage grid when the job asked for one: that grid reads no pixel of the exact frame, so it does not wait for it ([masking](masking.md#the-develop-workspace)). The desktop uploads the raster and presents it. This is the frame the input-to-presented figure measures.
2. **Exact phase.** The same worker then renders the full-resolution frame and, when the job asked, reduces it into the exact report. The desktop adopts the report and retains the raster, exactly as it does today, but uploads nothing at Fit. The retained exact raster is what the clipping overlay is derived from, what the 100% view uploads, and what the histogram describes.

A job at a percentage zoom whose displayed size does not fit the bounds — 100% and above on any photo-sized source — has no proxy phase: the single exact result is uploaded and analysed as today, so the 100% view stays the exact render of the exact recipe.

The exact phase is cancellable. Every rasterizing pass, the resample, the row pass both render domains share and the reducer check a cancellation token at chunk granularity, so a newer request stops an exact phase within about a millisecond of asking and returns a `cancelled` error rather than a frame. The queue delivers that outcome under the job's own generation, carrying no frame, so whatever waits for one generation learns that it has ended; a job replaced in the pending slot never starts, and `PreviewQueue::request_replacing` names it in the same step as the request that replaces it. The one generation the desktop waits for is a crop draft's truncated input stage: when a newer request supersedes it, the draft ends explicitly as a failed one does, and is never shielded or re-requested, because every such request but a view change comes from a change to the stack or selection that job was planned from. Each job carries two tokens: a newer request raises its **superseded** token and `PreviewQueue::cancel` its **abandoned** one, which also supersedes it. The exact phase reads the superseded token, so a wild drag never has a full-resolution render competing for the Rayon pool with the proxy render of the newest value; the proxy phase reads only the abandoned token, so the proxy frame of a value the pointer has just left is still rendered and delivered, because it is newer than anything on screen. The exact phase of the last value completes once the gesture pauses or ends, and the histogram then reads the drafted population it describes today. Between a proxy frame and its exact phase the plot is marked updating, as it is between any input and its report. A drafted preview is therefore still analysed exactly, and the [histogram contract](basic-and-histogram.md#histogram-and-clipping-contract) is unchanged: no proxy raster is ever reduced into a report. The one drafted preview that is not analysed at all is a RAW white balance approximated on the developed planes ([below](#a-raw-white-balance-during-a-drag)): neither of its phases is reduced, and the plot stays marked updating until an exact frame's report arrives.

During a gesture, before the exact phase of the newest frame has landed, the clipping overlay is re-derived from the proxy raster on screen so it follows the drag; its event and the state summary say `approximate: true` in that case, and the exact overlay replaces it when the exact phase lands. A single clipped pixel is never lost in a settled frame.

### No waiting on timers

- A slider move sends `draft.set` immediately when no round trip is in flight, and records only the newest value otherwise; the answer sends the newest value, as today. The 16 ms slider tick is removed. The bound is unchanged in substance: at most one draft round trip in flight, at most one preview job per accepted value, intermediate values coalesced.
- The preview and overlay workers wake the desktop when a result is ready, through one channel subscription that yields the same `Poll` message the timer used to. The 16 ms preview poll is removed; nothing wakes when nothing has finished, which is also the idle rule.
- Each worker is one persistent thread, the latest-job primitive in `luxforge_core::latest` that the histogram analysis also runs on. It sleeps until a job is requested and takes the pending job itself the moment the active one has handed over its last result, so the next proxy render never waits for the desktop to poll, nor behind the crop draft's input stage while the toolkit uploads it. At most two finished results wait for the desktop; a worker with a third to hand over waits for the desktop to take one.
- The `draft.set` round trip is not changed. Its measured cost is CPU contention with the full-resolution render, which the proxy removes.

### One frame per hop

Measured on the M4 Mac with per-leg timings: the owner answers `draft.set` and plans the preview job in under 0.2 ms, the desktop's own update, model derivation and view take under 0.15 ms together, and every message handed back into the update loop through the runtime — a task result, a worker's wake, an image allocation's answer — arrives about 8 ms later, one frame of the 120 Hz display. A redraw is always in flight during a drag, the main thread waits on its present, and a message that arrives meanwhile waits with it. The per-input path therefore has as few runtime hops as its work allows:

- The gesture's `draft.set` and preview-job requests are made synchronously on the desktop thread. They are two `O(layers)` owner requests; the owner does no frame work by rule, so the wait is bounded by catalog work alone.
- The photograph is drawn by a photo-surface primitive that owns its texture, at Fit and at every percentage: the raster handed to the view is written to that texture in the same frame that draws it, so no allocation round trip stands between the worker's result and the screen, and a redraw with no new raster writes nothing. The clipping overlay, the mask coverage and the crop draft's input stage are drawn by the same primitive from frames of their own, one holder in the desktop owning them all, so none of them waits for an allocation either. At a percentage the surface is the whole zoomed box inside a scrollable, far larger than the window, so it hands the renderer only the part on screen: the GPU viewport stays within the window, inside the device's 8192 px limit. An exact render wider or taller than that limit, such as a 60 MP photograph at 100%, is held in a grid of textures that meet without a seam.
- The worker's wake is the one hop that remains, because the raster has to reach the thread that draws. It is only on the way out: the next job starts without it. One `Poll` takes up every finished result that presents nothing — a cancelled or stale outcome, an exact phase adopted behind its proxy — and at most one frame, so each presented frame is drawn; it asks for another `Poll` only while a result still waits.

"Presented" in the harness is the update in which the raster became the surface's source; it is drawn by the redraw that update requests, which is the next frame.

### The Fit view is the proxy

At Fit, and at any zoom whose displayed size fits the bounds, the presented texture is the proxy render, for drafted and committed frames alike. The photograph therefore never changes appearance between the last drafted frame and the committed one: both are the same recipe at the same size through the same filter. This replaces the GPU's bilinear minification of a full-resolution texture with a box-filtered display-size render, which is a visible improvement in aliasing at Fit and a change to what a Fit capture contains. The exact render is still produced for every committed frame and stays the source of every number.

Zooming from Fit to 100% uploads the retained exact raster when the exact phase has landed and re-renders nothing; when it has not, the view waits for that phase with the existing loading state. Zooming back to Fit uploads the proxy again (a cache hit and a small upload). A view change still triggers no render. The proxy's 4096 px per side does not bound the exact texture, which is written whole for 100% inspection, in tiles of at most 8192 px a side when it is larger than that; the proxy is one texture by construction.

### A RAW white balance during a drag

A RAW white balance is applied to the sensor mosaic before the nonlinear demosaic, so an exact frame at a new temperature or tint needs the mosaic redeveloped on the source worker: about half a second on the Z6 and one and a half on the X100VI. A drag therefore previews its drafted value **approximately**, on the planes already developed, and redevelops only for the value it commits.

The retained planes are `R · D(g)` per pixel, where `D(g)` is the native demosaic of the mosaic after the sensor gains `g`, in camera RGB (the Air 2S's gain map and optical warp run per channel inside it), and `R` is LibRaw's `rgb_cam`, the camera-to-linear-sRGB matrix. To first order `D(g') ≈ diag(g'/g) · D(g)`, so planes developed at `g` approximate the planes at the drafted gains `g'` by

`W = R · diag(g'_c / g_c) · R⁻¹`

with `R⁻¹` computed in f64. `LinearSettings::white_balance` carries `W`, and the linear evaluator applies it to each source pixel before the exposure multiply, `2^EV · (W · p)`, at the one point where settings touch source pixels. Without it the evaluation is bit for bit the exact one.

- **Where it applies.** Only `EditorService::preview_job` for an open draft, when the draft's effective gains differ from the development held in memory and that development exists. Equal gains need no approximation. A camera matrix with no usable inverse is refused as `preparation-required`, never rendered through a matrix that cannot describe it.
- **Where it never applies.** A committed or historical preview, `render_entry` and so every export, `sample_entry` and `sample_draft` and so the pointer readout and `render.sample`, `analysis_plan`, and every pixel an action or query samples from its stage context all stay strict: a white balance the planes do not hold is `preparation-required` there, and the refusal names a development at that white balance. A drafted temperature's point sample is therefore refused while its preview approximates it.
- **Labelled and never analysed.** Both phases of such a job carry `PreviewResult::approximate_white_balance`, and the job is never reduced into a report even when it asked for one. The desktop presents the frames as it presents any frame, keeps the last exact report plotted and marked updating until an exact frame's report replaces it, marks a clipping overlay derived from one `approximate: true`, and says so in `preview_displayed` (`approximate_white_balance`), the state summary and the status bar: "Rendered in 7 ms (proxy, approximate)" at Fit, "(approximate)" at 100%.
- **The proxy and 100%.** The matrix is linear and the proxy's box filter is linear, so `W` applies to the proxy exactly as to the full frame (they commute to f32 rounding, which is a test), and the proxy phase is the approximate recipe rendered against the exact downscale, byte for byte. The proxy cache keys on the development and takes settings from the job, so a drag hits the proxy the committed frame built. At 100% the drag gets the approximate full-size frame with no proxy phase. The spatial estimate store keys an approximate evaluation apart from an exact one of the same recipe, so a committed Presence render never takes a global estimated from approximate pixels.
- **Release.** The commit redevelops the mosaic on the source worker exactly as before, and the last approximate frame stays on screen until the committed frame replaces it: the `raw-panel` smoke scenario checks that the committed frame is the first one handed to the surface after the commit, at Fit and at 100%. A drafted value whose development is not in memory at all — evicted while a redevelopment or source preparation of an earlier request is in flight — is still `preparation-required` and has no frame of its own; the status bar says it shows on release.

**Accuracy.** Measured on the three supplied RAW files by the ignored `measure_the_white_balance_approximation_against_redevelopment` test: planes developed at the camera's as-shot gains, rendered through `W` for each Custom target, against an exact redevelopment at the same gains, both rendered to 8-bit sRGB at a display proxy (bounds 2400 × 1600) and at full size. Mean |Δ| is per channel (R/G/B) in codes; p99 and max are of each pixel's largest channel difference.

| Camera | Target | Proxy mean | Proxy p99 | Proxy max | Proxy > 2 codes | Full mean | Full p99 | Full max | Full > 2 codes |

For scale, the as-shot frame itself is 24/6/24 codes from the 3200 K target on the Z6 and 26/6/18 on the X100VI, so the approximation removes nearly all of the difference a drag is about. The difference images place the rest where the demosaic couples the channels: on the Z6, thin high-contrast edges (bamboo slats, poles and wire against the sky, distant structures) and small specular glints, with flat and smoothly shaded areas within a code; on the X100VI at 3200 K, a fine per-pixel speckle across the saturated yellow petals and along their edges; on the Air 2S, the sparkling shallow water and sand at every target and, at 3200 K — the largest gain change measured, red × 0.68 and blue × 1.79 — the textured foliage and rock broadly. The approximation is shown only while the pointer is down and is replaced by the exact frame on release; the Air 2S's larger error at strong changes is visible during a drag and is not otherwise bounded.

**The `raw-panel` check** (owner decision, 2026-09-26) asserts, at both zooms, that the released exact frame's mean distance from the drafted approximate frame, over the photo surface, is at most a tenth of its distance from the frame before the drag: the approximation removes at least 90% of the difference the drag is about. At Fit it also asserts that the released frame is within one code of the drafted one on average. A drafted frame that never moved scores about the whole change, so a stale or wrong frame still fails. The drags are as shot to 3500 K at Fit and 3500 K to 2500 K at 100%. Mean |Δ| over the surface, released against drafted and, for scale, released against the frame before the drag:

| Source | Fit, 3500 K | 100%, 2500 K |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Z6 | 0.019 of 6.47 codes (0.3%) | 0.206 of 25.55 (0.8%) |
| X100VI | 0.048 of 9.40 (0.5%) | 0.603 of 43.45 (1.4%) |
| Air 2S | 0.345 of 11.34 (3.0%) | 1.223 of 24.23 (5.0%) |

The Air 2S's error at 100% is broad, not specular: per channel 2.28/0.52/0.87, red biased low by 1.21; 27% of pixels over two codes, p90 of the largest channel 6 and p99 29; the pixels with a channel at 250 or above in the exact frame are 3% of the surface and carry 17% of the error, and without them the mean is still 1.05. On the full sensor, pixels within 3% of a channel's clip ceiling (the RCD input clamp, times the gain map) and their 2-pixel neighbourhood are 3% of the frame and 19% of the error; the rest averages 0.95 codes. It is the demosaic's colour-difference interpolation, which is not equivariant under a gain change (its error goes as `(1 − k) · (G − local mean of G)` at interpolated sites), on a low-exposure sensor whose gain map reaches 4.1–4.7. Two candidate improvements were measured on the full sensor and rejected: clamping at the clip ceiling with clipped channels taken as sensor-saturated lowers the 100% case from 1.13 to 1.06 codes and would need the gain map inside the evaluator; adding a green high-pass correction lowers it to 1.00 and is a neighbourhood operation, which the per-pixel `W` and its commuting with the proxy downscale rule out.

| X100VI | Exposure, for comparison | 11.9 / 21.3 ms | 26 / 134 ms | 5.8–6.6 |

The approximate proxy phase itself renders in 7.4 / 12.6 ms on the Z6 (1049 × 1576) and 8.5 / 9.0 ms on the X100VI (1716 × 1144), and its full-size phase in 129 / 164 and 143 / 148 ms, the cost of an exact RAW frame. A wild drag (`--mode burst`, 360 values over 3 s) presents 43.2 frames per second with a staleness of 16.5 / 34.7 ms on the Z6 temperature slider and 35.7 at 16.6 / 30.6 ms on the X100VI's, against 48.8 at 16.7 / 40.2 ms for RAW exposure on the Z6 (load average 5.9–7.4). Every drafted value produced a labelled frame and no report was adopted from one: 32 approximate proxy frames and 3 reports (the open and the two commits) in each white-balance drag run, against 33 reports in the exposure runs.

### What is preserved

- Originals, recipes, history, drafts, commits, the API and every mutation are untouched. The proxy is desktop preview state and appears in no history and no persisted data.
- Exactness claims are about the exact phase: fixtures, reference tests and the histogram contract stand. The proxy is proven exact at its own scale: a proxy render equals the exact recipe rendered against the exact downscale of the source, byte for byte, which is the test; a windowed one equals it too, and with a spatial layer equals the whole proxy stage rendered with the exact stage's estimates.
- The RAW retained mosaic and float development are unchanged; only their preview reads a smaller plane set. A committed RAW white balance still redevelops the mosaic on the source worker; a drafted one is approximated on the developed planes, labelled, and never analysed, as described above.
- Bounds: one proxy source (≤ 96 MiB without a crop; under a crop, the window the crop reads within the display bounds plus the margins above, whatever the crop's tightness), one proxy raster per job, the cancellation token; no new timer, no private pool.

## Evidence

- Core: exactness of the downscale on synthetic fixtures (integer scales average exactly; fractional coverage weights sum to one; a uniform image is unchanged; RAW planes through a cropped, oriented view), eligibility, cache identity, the two-phase queue order, cancellation latency on a 24 MP synthetic frame, and the proxy-equals-exact-at-proxy-scale test. For a cropped stack: a windowed downscale is the whole downscale's pixels in its window for both source kinds; a windowed proxy frame is byte for byte the whole proxy stage's for straight and straightened tight crops behind an orientation, a masked colour layer and a vignette, on both pixel domains, and with Presence (masked and not) the whole stage rendered with the exact stage's estimates; the window is bounded by the display, not by the crop's tightness; and the worker's cache hits the window under the same crop and rebuilds it for a moved one (`render::window` and `preview::tests`).
- Desktop: the existing `basic`, `basic-crop`, `histogram`, `large24`, `large60`, `crop` and `crop-draft` smoke scenarios keep passing with their correlated state, and their captured frames record `proxy` beside `dimensions`; a `Settle::SliderDraft` or `Settle::Preview` step settles only once the proxy is presented and, when the job asked for a report, its exact phase is adopted.
- Timing: `editor-latency` in drag, commit and the new burst mode on 24 MP, 60 MP and the 24 MP crop stack, 30 samples, and `raw-editor` on the manifest sources; `editor-performance` gains the proxy build and proxy render rows. The `verify` timing tier reports the targets above beside the existing ones.
- Events: `preview_displayed` carries `proxy: bool` and, when true, `proxy_dimensions`, and `render_ms`, the worker's own time for the phase on screen (`PreviewResult::render_ms`), which is also the status bar's "Rendered in N ms"; `analysis_adopted` is unchanged; a `preview_exact_cancelled` event names each superseded exact phase by its own generation, with `draft` when it was a crop draft's input stage; the state summary carries `proxy: {eligible, dimensions, bounds}`.
- RAW white balance: core tests of `W` against independent references (applied before the exposure, identity with no approximation, the camera-space mapping, singular and non-finite refusals), the draft-only settings mode, both phases labelled and never reduced, the proxy against the exact downscale under `W`, the downscale commuting with `W`, a drafted job hitting the committed frame's proxy and the estimate store keeping approximate and exact apart; an ignored real-file test proving every strict path refuses while the draft's preview approximates, run on the Z6, X100VI and Air 2S; the desktop's own test of the labels and the histogram; and the `raw-panel` smoke scenario's drags at Fit and at 100%.

## Proposals and later work

Recorded here as proposals, not decisions.

- **Coarser proxy while the pointer moves.** With every Basic unit active, the proxy render is the largest remaining cost per input (about 50 ms at 24 MP under a rotated crop on this host). Rendering at half the display size while inputs keep arriving, then at display size once they pause, would cut that fourfold at the cost of a softer picture during the movement itself; it is a measured proposal, taken only if the GPU stage below is not.
- **GPU colour stage.** If the proxy render of the full Basic layer still misses the two-frame target at Fit, the next step is to draw the proxy of the drafted layer's input stage through an `iced` shader primitive and apply the colour units as a fragment program with the coefficients as uniforms, so a tick costs a uniform write. That needs a WGSL transcription of each unit, a headless readback test against the CPU path within one code, and a fallback to the CPU proxy whenever a unit has no GPU program. The proxy source and the two-phase job are the foundation it needs and are built so that it changes only the presentation of the proxy phase.
- **Viewport tiles at 100%.** A drag at 100% still renders the whole exact frame. The inverse rectangle walk already exists in `WindowPlan::of` / `apply` for cropped proxies; the proposal below extends it to the viewport.
- **Reduced pool.** Leaving one or two cores out of the shared Rayon pool for the desktop and owner threads may lower jitter; it is a measurement, not a default.

### Viewport rendering at 100% (proposal)

The [interactive-adjustments investigation](../research/interactive-adjustments.md) finds that
100% currently waits for both off-screen CPU rendering and whole-raster GPU upload. A viewport
render can retain exact 1:1 detail while avoiding that work. This section is a proposal; it does
not change the current two-phase contract or claim an implemented speedup.

- **Plan the requested rectangle.** Add a proposed `WindowPlan::of_rect` entry point that starts
  the existing reverse walk from a non-empty, clipped output rectangle instead of the whole final
  stage. Compile against full stage dimensions, then retain each required intermediate region,
  resampling taps, spatial halo and tile-grid alignment. Preserve explicit fallback for unsupported
  operations; the existing window planner refuses some positional/pixel operations and global
  estimates behind earlier spatial operations.
- **Preserve coordinates.** Finish units such as vignette currently receive frame coordinates,
  and a positional segment cannot be cut. Give a cut region its full-stage origin while retaining
  the unit's original stage dimensions, so a pan does not recenter the vignette. Masks likewise
  evaluate in their declared stage through the same geometry. Do not simulate a viewport by adding
  a recipe crop, which could change subsequent effect semantics and history.
- **Read a source region.** Compose the needed rectangle with RAW's existing `LinearImage` view,
  sharing its planes. For the byte domain, design an immutable origin/stride view over the shared
  source; a bounded region copy is an alternative to measure if a view complicates the evaluator.
  Never make a full-source copy to obtain a small visible window. Validate composition with all
  source orientations and existing views.
- **Preserve global context.** Use exact whole-stage estimates keyed to their actual inputs for an
  exact viewport. Dehaze's global estimate must not be recomputed from only the visible rectangle,
  which would change appearance when panning. An upstream edit can invalidate that estimate; this
  is remaining full-image work, not a viewport speedup. Approximate estimates would require their
  own measured preview contract.
- **Present a region.** Carry full output dimensions, region origin, recipe/draft generation,
  view identity and quality with the raster. Upload only the new region and position it in the
  full canvas. Bound retained regions and pending work; reject obsolete results after pan, zoom,
  resize or another input. Current texture tiling only handles device dimension limits and still
  uploads the entire frame. Reuse the current full raster on settled pans when available; a pan
  into unavailable current detail may request region work. That would be an explicit exception to
  the current rule that view changes never render.
- **Separate visible detail from full-image analysis.** Recommend prioritizing the visible result
  while moving and on release, then completing the whole frame and histogram on pause/release.
  Keep the previous exact histogram/counters marked updating; never substitute a viewport-only
  histogram. Clipping over the visible current region can reflect its pixels with an appropriate
  quality label, separately from whole-image counts. This extension beyond the accepted Fit
  experiment has the owner's [acceptance of temporary softness and an updating histogram](../decisions.md#interactive-previews-at-100).
  The proposed clipping-overlay policy and measured quality levels remain outstanding.

Acceptance requires whole-buffer equality with the matching region of an exact full render,
including fractional/rotated crops, masks, finish effects, spatial seams and estimates; bounded
CPU/GPU residency; generation-correct pan/release behavior; and native input-to-present timings
on photo-sized JPEG/RAW stacks. Viewport-only output must not satisfy a full-frame analysis,
sample, export or evidence request. Unsupported region plans retain an explicit existing-path
fallback. Implementation and its task-plan extension follow the outstanding product choices.
