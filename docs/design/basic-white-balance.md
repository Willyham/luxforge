# White balance: the relative transform and the neutral picker

Status: frozen and implemented. The numerical study froze every constant and formula here ahead of implementation, and Temperature, Tint and the neutral picker were then coded against this document, unguessed. Production lives in `crates/luxforge-core/src/modules/basic/white_balance.rs` (the pointwise unit and the solver) and `modules/basic/mod.rs` (the parameters and the `neutral-sample` query), and is checked against the independent reference below within the pointwise contract's default `1e-6 + 1e-6 × |reference|`. See [Basic and histogram](basic-and-histogram.md) for the surrounding product and integration contract, and [product decisions](../decisions.md#basic-adjustments-and-histogram) for the picker default and rejection rules this document freezes.

Nothing here is a claim of equivalence to Lightroom, Adobe Camera Raw or any camera's Kelvin metadata. Temperature and Tint are **relative corrections of an already-rendered SDR JPEG**, not a reconstruction of scene illuminant. [Lightroom research](../research/lightroom/tone-and-color-tools.md#white-balance) found "no exact Adobe gain computation was recovered" and warned that "Kelvin and tint are user-facing descriptions, not directly portable RGB gains" — this document does not attempt to recover or match them.

## Summary

- **Transform:** von Kries chromatic adaptation in Bradford LMS space. Linear sRGB (D65) → CIE XYZ → Bradford LMS → per-channel gain → back. The gain is `LMS(D65) / LMS(target)`, where `target` is a chromaticity Temperature/Tint select relative to the true sRGB D65 white point.
- **Temperature** moves the target along a mired shift referenced to the Planckian locus (Kim et al. 2002 approximation); **Tint** moves it perpendicular to the locus in CIE 1960 `(u, v)`. Both are anchored so that `(0, 0)` reproduces the sRGB D65 white point exactly, not approximately.
- **Picker:** average a (≤ 5×5, edge-clipped) patch in linear sRGB, reject near-black/clipped/non-finite samples, then invert the same target map with a bounded 2-D Newton solver (tolerance `1e-6` in `(u, v)`, ≤ 64 iterations), reject an out-of-range result rather than clamp it.
- Verified in `crates/luxforge-reference/src/white_balance.rs` and `crates/luxforge-reference/tests/studies/white_balance.rs`; expected values are in [`fixtures/basic/white-balance-cases.json`](../../fixtures/basic/white-balance-cases.json).

## Why Bradford von Kries, not a simpler channel gain

The [parent design](basic-and-histogram.md#white-balance-and-neutral-picker) allows either a chromatic-adaptation transform or a simpler linear-sRGB channel-gain model, provided the choice is justified against fixtures. A plain per-channel gain (`R,G,B` each scaled independently) was tried first, informally, while shaping this study: it is a one-line formula but has no principled way to derive a *pair* of gains from a *single* chromaticity target without an extra free parameter (the third channel's gain is then either redundant or has to be fixed by a separate rule), and it processes each channel identically regardless of the eye's differing sensitivity in each cone response — a saturated colour's hue shifts differently than a chromatic-adaptation model shifts it. Bradford LMS is the standard, widely published cone-response space color-managed workflows already use for exactly this operation (display white-point adaptation), it has a natural closed relationship between "a target chromaticity" and "a diagonal gain," and — as the worked examples and the visual review below show — it produces plausible, monotone warm/cool and green/magenta behaviour on both a synthetic step-wedge and a real photo. It was kept.

## Colour spaces and constants

All colour math is IEEE 754 `f64` in the reference; production code runs the pointwise pipeline in `f32` per the [pointwise contract](basic-and-histogram.md#pointwise-foundation-and-exposure), with coefficients computed in `f64` as that contract requires.

### Forward matrices

Linear sRGB (D65) to CIE XYZ, the IEC 61966-2-1 primaries and white point:

```text
RGB_TO_XYZ = [ 0.4124564  0.3575761  0.1804375 ]
             [ 0.2126729  0.7151522  0.0721750 ]
             [ 0.0193339  0.1191920  0.9503041 ]
```

CIE XYZ to Bradford cone-response space, the 1985 Bradford matrix:

```text
XYZ_TO_LMS = [  0.8951000  0.2664000 -0.1614000 ]
             [ -0.7502000  1.7135000  0.0367000 ]
             [  0.0389000 -0.0685000  1.0296000 ]
```

### The inverse matrices must be computed, not copied

`RGB_TO_XYZ` and `XYZ_TO_LMS` are the only forward constants this document states. An implementation must compute their inverses at `f64` precision with the exact 3×3 adjugate/determinant formula (`mat3_inverse` in the reference), **not** substitute separately-published "XYZ to RGB" or "Bradford inverse" constants. This is not a style preference: two independently-rounded 7-digit matrices compose to identity only to about `1e-7` (measured while building this reference), which fails the `1e-12` identity requirement below outright. Computing the inverse of the *same* forward matrix the code already uses composes to identity to double-precision (about `1e-15`) regardless of how many digits the forward matrix itself was published with, because the arithmetic is then exactly self-cancelling up to floating-point rounding. For reference/sanity-checking only (an implementation must still compute these itself), the exact inverses of the matrices above are:

```text
XYZ_TO_RGB ≈ [  3.2404548360 -1.5371388501 -0.4985315469 ]

```

### The anchor white point

`D65_X = 0.3127`, `D65_Y = 0.3290` — the IEC 61966-2-1 sRGB reference white, the same chromaticity `RGB_TO_XYZ` was built from. This is the point the transform reproduces **exactly** at Temperature 0 / Tint 0. It is deliberately kept separate from the "nominal CCT" below: D65 is a daylight illuminant, not a blackbody, and sits a small, well-known distance off the Planckian locus. Anchoring the transform at the Planckian point for "6504 K" instead of at the true D65 chromaticity was tried first and produced a mid-grey output about 2% off input at `(0, 0)` — nowhere near `1e-12` — which is why the anchor and the locus-direction reference below are two different, explicitly distinguished constants.

`D65_NOMINAL_CCT = 6504.0` — the commonly cited correlated colour temperature of the sRGB/D65 white point. Used only as the zero of the mired shift and the point at which the locus tangent direction is read; the transform never assumes this point's own `(x, y)` equals `D65_X`/`D65_Y`.

## Temperature: mired shift along the Planckian locus

```text
mired(t) = 1e6 / D65_NOMINAL_CCT − t · K_T          K_T = 1.0375 (mired per unit)
kelvin(t) = 1e6 / mired(t)
```

Positive Temperature **decreases** the mired value, i.e. raises the nominal correlated colour temperature (bluer). `K_T` is chosen so `t = +100` reaches a nominal `kelvin(100) ≈ 19999.4 K` (≈ 20000 K). Because mired and Kelvin are reciprocally related, a single linear-in-mired mapping anchored at D65's own mired (≈153.75) cannot be symmetric in Kelvin: `t = -100` reaches a nominal `kelvin(-100) ≈ 3883.5 K` (≈ 3900 K), not 2000 K. This asymmetry is inherent to the mired construction, not a bug; a camera or editor's own Temperature slider is not symmetric in Kelvin either. Both endpoints stay comfortably inside the Kim et al. approximation's valid domain (1667 K–25000 K, see below).

The **direction** Temperature moves the target chromaticity, not the exact Kelvin figure above, is what matters to the transform. That direction is read from the Planckian locus:

```text
planckian_locus_xy(kelvin):  (Kim, Kim, Tamatsu, Konig, Kim 2002 cubic approximation, valid 1667 K–25000 K)
  if kelvin <= 4000:
    x = -0.2661239e9/kelvin^3 - 0.2343589e6/kelvin^2 + 0.8776956e3/kelvin + 0.179910
  else:
    x = -3.0258469e9/kelvin^3 + 2.1070379e6/kelvin^2 + 0.2226347e3/kelvin + 0.240390
  if kelvin <= 2222:      y = -1.1063814 x^3 - 1.34811020 x^2 + 2.18555832 x - 0.20219683
  elif kelvin <= 4000:    y = -0.9549476 x^3 - 1.37418593 x^2 + 2.09137015 x - 0.16748867
  else:                   y =  3.0817580 x^3 - 5.87338670 x^2 + 3.75112997 x - 0.37001483
```

This is a **model of a blackbody radiator**, reproduced from its widely published coefficients (e.g. the "Planckian locus" article's Approximation section). It is used only to obtain a smooth, well-known warm/cool direction in chromaticity space — not a claim that any JPEG illuminant is a blackbody, and not a reproduction of any camera or Lightroom Kelvin value.

CIE 1931 `(x, y)` converts to CIE 1960 `(u, v)` by the standard formula `u = 4x / (-2x + 12y + 3)`, `v = 6y / (-2x + 12y + 3)` (and back by `x = 3u / (2u - 8v + 4)`, `y = 2v / (2u - 8v + 4)`).

## Tint: perpendicular offset in CIE 1960 (u, v)

```text
K_TINT = 0.00020   (uv units per Tint unit)
```

At the nominal Kelvin the temperature step selected, take the locus's unit tangent `(tu, tv)` by a 1 K forward difference, then rotate it -90° to `(tv, -tu)`. That is the perpendicular direction; Tint moves the target by `tint · K_TINT · (tv, -tu)`. The rotation sign is not a free choice stated without proof: it is the one that makes positive Tint raise R and B while lowering G (magenta), locked in and checked by `positive_tint_is_magenta` in the reference tests. The other rotation sign produces green for positive Tint, which would contradict the required "positive tint = more magenta" convention.

## Assembling the target chromaticity and the gains

```text
target_uv(t, tint):
  mired = 1e6/D65_NOMINAL_CCT - t·K_T ;  kelvin = 1e6/mired
  (u_p0, v_p0) = locus_uv(D65_NOMINAL_CCT)      # the locus point at the anchor Kelvin
  (u_p,  v_p)  = locus_uv(kelvin)               # the locus point at the shifted Kelvin
  (tu, tv) = tangent_unit(kelvin)               # locus unit tangent at the shifted Kelvin
  (u_d65, v_d65) = xy_to_uv(D65_X, D65_Y)
  u = u_d65 + (u_p - u_p0) + tint·K_TINT·tv
  v = v_d65 + (v_p - v_p0) + tint·K_TINT·(-tu)
```

At `t = 0, tint = 0`: `u_p == u_p0` and `v_p == v_p0` **by construction** — they are the same function evaluated at the same input twice — and the tint term is zero, so `target_uv(0, 0) == (u_d65, v_d65)` exactly, algebraically, independent of floating-point rounding anywhere else in the formula. This is why the anchor/locus separation above is load-bearing: the offsets are zero *by cancellation*, not by the Planckian curve happening to pass through D65.

```text
gains(t, tint):
  if t == 0 and tint == 0: return [1, 1, 1]                          # exact special case, see below
  (u, v) = target_uv(t, tint) ;  lms_target = LMS_of_uv(u, v)
  lms_d65 = LMS_of_uv(xy_to_uv(D65_X, D65_Y))
  return [ lms_d65[i] / lms_target[i] for i in L, M, S ]

apply(t, tint, rgb):
  if t == 0 and tint == 0: return rgb                                # exact special case
  xyz  = RGB_TO_XYZ · rgb ;  lms = XYZ_TO_LMS · xyz
  lms2 = lms * gains(t, tint)                     # componentwise
  xyz2 = LMS_TO_XYZ · lms2 ;  return XYZ_TO_RGB · xyz2
```

`LMS_of_uv(u, v)` converts back to `(x, y)`, builds `XYZ = (x/y, 1, (1-x-y)/y)` (unit luminance — chromaticity only, since a gain ratio is luminance-independent), and applies `XYZ_TO_LMS`.

### The `(0, 0)` identity: proved to `1e-12`, special-cased for exactness

Because `target_uv(0, 0)` is algebraically the anchor point, `gains(0, 0)` computed by the general formula is `[1, 1, 1]` to within floating-point rounding of the `uv → xy → XYZ → LMS` round trip, and the whole matrix sandwich composes to identity to about `1e-15` (using the *computed* inverses above) — the reference's `identity_at_zero_zero_is_exact_to_1e12` test checks this on seven representative colours including out-of-gamut ones, and `identity_on_all_256_greys_through_quantizer` checks it through the 8-bit round trip for every grey code. Both pass at roughly `1e-15`–`1e-16`, three orders of magnitude inside the `1e-12` requirement.

The implementation must **still** special-case `temperature == 0.0 && tint == 0.0` to skip the general formula and return the input unchanged (`gains` returns `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]` literally). This is not needed for correctness — the general formula already proves close enough — but it is required so a neutral Basic layer's white-balance unit is bit-identical to no unit at all (the parent contract: "zero-valued Basic must not introduce round-trip changes") and costs nothing when neutral.

## Sign conventions

- **Positive Temperature warms** the image: R rises, B falls, relative to Temperature 0 at the same Tint. **Negative cools**: R falls, B rises. Proved monotone (strictly, at every integer step from -100 to 100, at five different Tint values) by `temperature_monotonic_over_full_range`.
- **Positive Tint is magenta**: R and B both rise, G falls. **Negative Tint is green**: R and B fall, G rises. Proved by `positive_tint_is_magenta` and, at every integer step, by `tint_monotonic_over_full_range` (using the proxy `(R+B)/2 - G`, which is monotone strictly increasing in Tint at every temperature tested).

These conventions match the ordinary photo-editor sense of "warmer"/"cooler" and "green"/"magenta," which is what the parent contract asks for ("matching the familiar UI convention"); they are not derived from or checked against Lightroom's own slider behaviour.

## Worked examples

Applying `apply(t, tint, [0.5, 0.5, 0.5])` (a mid-grey linear triple), full-precision output, tint or temperature held at 0:

| t | tint | R | G | B |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0 | 0.500000 | 0.500000 | 0.500000 |
| +50 | 0 | 0.585155 | 0.493096 | 0.359174 |
| -50 | 0 | 0.405768 | 0.512416 | 0.703270 |
| +100 | 0 | 0.657367 | 0.491680 | 0.265694 |
| -100 | 0 | 0.304845 | 0.529113 | 0.996086 |
| 0 | +50 | 0.566099 | 0.475589 | 0.559511 |
| 0 | -50 | 0.432305 | 0.526576 | 0.448909 |
| 0 | +100 | 0.631024 | 0.452916 | 0.629875 |
| 0 | -100 | 0.362466 | 0.555823 | 0.404454 |

A saturated, near-blue patch `[0.05, 0.1, 0.8]` warmed hard (`t = -100`, i.e. cooled — negative temperature) pushes red **negative** (`R ≈ -0.0139`) while staying finite: this is preserved, not clamped, inside the unit, per the pointwise contract's "negative channels preserved, no clamp inside the unit." The same patch magenta-shifted (`tint = +100`) and warmed (`t = +100`) both stay finite and in a plausible range. `fixtures/basic/white-balance-cases.json`'s `transform_cases` carries 45 such cases (5 input colours × 9 parameter pairs) at full `f64` precision.

## The neutral picker

### Patch averaging and edge clipping

The picker samples up to 5×5 = 25 pixels centred on the picked input-stage pixel, at pixel centres, before the target Basic layer (so it sees the same stage the parent contract specifies). A pixel position outside `[0, width) × [0, height)` is dropped rather than clamped to the edge or wrapped — "clipped at the image edges" — so a corner sample can be as small as a single pixel (never zero, since the centre itself is always in bounds). Averaging is the arithmetic mean, per channel, of the pixels' **decoded linear-sRGB** values (not of the encoded bytes).

### Rejection

Checked in this order:

1. **Clipped**: any sampled pixel has any channel at code 0 or 255. Checked on the raw bytes, before decoding or averaging — a single blown highlight or crushed shadow pixel in the patch rejects the whole sample.
2. **Near-black**: the patch's mean relative luminance (`Y`, the same `0.2126729·R + 0.7151522·G + 0.0721750·B` row `RGB_TO_XYZ` already uses) is below `NEAR_BLACK_LUMINANCE = 0.02`. That is about sRGB code 39 for a neutral grey — dark enough that colour information is unreliable, and it also protects the solver's `XYZ → xy` division from a near-zero denominator.
3. **Non-finite**: any sampled or computed value is not finite. Unreachable from real 8-bit input by construction (`srgb_decode` of any byte is finite), but checked defensively since the same solver machinery may later be reused for a drafted linear buffer that isn't 8-bit-quantized.

### Solving

The patch average's own chromaticity — `xy` from `RGB_TO_XYZ · patch`, normalized by `X+Y+Z` — is the same kind of point `target_uv(t, tint)` produces. Solving for `(t, tint)` is therefore inverting `target_uv`: find the pair whose `target_uv` equals the patch's `(u, v)`. Applying that pair's gains to a patch whose own chromaticity is `target_uv(t, tint)` maps it back onto the D65 anchor by construction (the same identity the `(0, 0)` proof rests on, generalized) — this is what makes the picker "reproducible": the solver and the forward transform share one function, not two independently-tuned halves.

Bounded 2-D Newton's method, seeded at `(0, 0)`:

```text
h = 1e-3 (finite-difference step, parameter units)
repeat up to 64 times:
  r = target_uv(t, tint) - (patch_u, patch_v)
  if |r| < 1e-6: converged
  J = finite-difference Jacobian of target_uv at (t, tint), step h
  if J singular or non-finite: not converged
  (t, tint) -= J^-1 · r
  if t or tint non-finite: not converged
```

`SOLVER_TOLERANCE = 1e-6` (Euclidean distance in CIE 1960 `(u, v)`) and `SOLVER_MAX_ITERATIONS = 64` are the values the parent contract's own example suggested, adopted as frozen. In practice every representable correction converges in well under ten iterations: the round-trip grid below converges in 1–7 iterations everywhere on the required `-100..100` step-20 grid. A patch whose required correction is far outside the representable range (a strongly saturated, clearly non-neutral colour) either fails to converge within 64 iterations or lands on a wildly out-of-range value; both are rejected, never silently accepted.

**Rounding and its residual.** The converged continuous `(t, tint)` is rounded to the nearest integer (the parameters' step is 1, standard round-half-away-from-zero). Measured directly: `target_uv` moves by at most about `4×10⁻⁴` CIE 1960 `(u, v)` units per Temperature step (varying slightly over the range) and exactly `2×10⁻⁴` per Tint step, so rounding moves the target chromaticity by at most half of that — call it `2×10⁻⁴` combined, an order of magnitude below the solver's own `1e-6` convergence tolerance's neighbourhood of relevance and far below any visible chromaticity difference. In output terms: re-applying the rounded parameters to the original (unrounded) patch, across two thousand randomized `(t, tint)` pairs at a representative `0.18` relative luminance, left a worst-case channel spread (`max − min` of the three corrected channels) of `0.0018` in linear sRGB; **this design accepts a residual channel spread of up to `0.005`** as "the rounded parameters, re-applied, leave a residual the design accepts." No exception near the range ends was found beyond that bound at the continuous level — see the next section for why an 8-bit *patch* is a different story.

**Out-of-range is reported, never clamped.** After rounding, if either axis exceeds `-100..100`, the picker returns a structured `OutOfRange { temperature, value }` reason rather than clamping to ±100. `rejects_out_of_range_correction_without_clamping` constructs a patch whose true required correction is `temperature = 120` and checks the solver converges (the map is well-defined there) and is then rejected, not silently truncated.

### Why a 5×5 patch, not one pixel

One finding from building this reference is worth documenting explicitly, because it explains a design choice the parent contract states but does not derive: **a single 8-bit pixel is not enough signal to recover Tint reliably.** One Tint unit moves the target chromaticity by only `2×10⁻⁴` `(u, v)` units — comparable in magnitude to the chromaticity noise a single ±1-code rounding error introduces after decode. Solving from one quantized pixel (verified directly) can misplace the recovered Tint by several units, occasionally even for a plausible, in-range true value. Averaging the full patch — 25 independent samples, which in a real photograph carry ordinary pixel-to-pixel texture rather than being bit-identical — reduces that noise by roughly the square root of the sample count and recovers the true integer parameters exactly across the required round-trip grid (next section). The reference's synthetic test patches use an explicit ordered dither across their 25 samples for the same reason a real patch would show one naturally: it demonstrates the averaging benefit the 5×5 sample size exists to provide, rather than testing a patch no real picker click would ever produce (25 bit-identical pixels).

### Round-trip verification

For every `(t, tint)` on the `-100..100` step-20 grid (121 pairs): construct the target chromaticity via `target_uv(t, tint)`, build a synthetic 0.5-relative-luminance patch whose 25 dithered 8-bit samples average to that chromaticity, solve, and round. `solver_round_trips_over_grid_within_one_unit` checks every one of the 121 pairs recovers **exactly**, not merely within one unit — the stated one-unit bound left headroom that a dithered patch did not need. `fixtures/basic/white-balance-cases.json`'s `solver_cases` stores all 121 patches and their recovered parameters, plus a near-black rejection, a clipped-pixel rejection, an out-of-range (`temperature = 120`) rejection, and one edge-clipped 3×3 corner patch (9 of 25 samples) that still solves.

## Finite and gamut behaviour

- Negative and above-1.0 channel values are preserved between white balance and any later unit; nothing inside `apply` clamps. `gains_finite_and_positive_over_full_range` checks every gain stays finite and strictly positive on a `5`-step grid over the whole `-100..100 × -100..100` domain, and `saturated_patch_produces_predictable_finite_output` checks four saturated/out-of-gamut inputs at the four range extremes stay finite (one case is asserted negative-and-finite, matching the pointwise contract's stated behaviour).
- A non-finite **output** can only arise from a non-finite **input**, since gains are always finite and strictly positive across the entire representable range — consistent with the surrounding pointwise contract's rule that a non-finite result after any unit is an explicit `resource-limit` error, never a silently-clipped or NaN value.
- The neutral-picker solver treats a non-finite intermediate (only reachable while chasing a patch whose chromaticity is far enough from any representable correction that the Newton iterate has left the locus's well-behaved region) as immediate non-convergence rather than continuing to spend iteration budget on it.

## Visual review

Ignored tests (`crates/luxforge-reference/tests/studies/white_balance_visual.rs`, not run by `cargo test`, no images committed) render the reference at `(-100,0)`, `(-50,0)`, `(50,0)`, `(100,0)`, `(0,-100)`, `(0,100)` over `fixtures/s0/orientation-1.jpg` (the synthetic red/green/blue/gold quadrant fixture) and over a synthetic 64×64 grey checkerboard with a known cast (linear channels multiplied by `[1.25, 1.05, 0.65]`, simulating a warm, slightly green light source), writing PNGs to a temp directory. Findings from inspecting them directly:

- **Temperature -100** (cool) on the quadrant photo: the red quadrant shifts toward crimson/magenta, the green quadrant toward teal, the blue quadrant becomes more saturated blue, and the gold quadrant becomes dull olive-yellow — everything visibly pulled toward blue, including saturated colours, which is expected of a global chromatic-adaptation gain rather than a neutrals-only correction.
- **Temperature +100** (warm): the reverse — red stays red but slightly more orange, green becomes a punchier yellow-green, blue shifts toward indigo/violet (less pure, since its dominant channel is the one being suppressed), and gold becomes a warmer amber. Both directions are smooth and match "warm"/"cool" as an ordinary viewer would name them.
- **Tint -100** (green) and **+100** (magenta): the green and gold quadrants (the ones with the most to show on this axis) visibly shift toward pure green and toward orange/magenta respectively; the effect is present but visually gentler than the temperature extremes at the same magnitude, consistent with `K_TINT` being chosen smaller than a naive reading of "spans the same visual range" might suggest — it was picked, as stated above, to avoid an implausibly extreme cast at ±100, not to match Temperature's visual magnitude.
- **Synthetic cast recovery**: the checkerboard's original tiles render as a warm tan/beige, as the `[1.25, 1.05, 0.65]` gain implies. Sampling a 5×5 patch from one tile and solving recovered `(temperature, tint) = (-57, 20)` — a cooling, slightly-magenta correction, exactly the sign combination the cast's gains imply (R and G boosted, B suppressed is a warm-with-a-touch-of-green cast, and the recovered correction is cool-with-a-touch-of-magenta, its antidote). Applying that correction back to the whole checkerboard produces a visibly neutral grey image; the sampled patch's own centre pixel became exactly `(209, 209, 209)` — R = G = B to the code. The corrected image is not claimed to reproduce the *original* pre-cast image exactly (the gain-triple cast and the Bradford model are different constructions, as the design's summary already states no equivalence claim), only that the picker finds a correction that visibly neutralizes the sampled region, which is what the contract asks of it.

No exceptions to the expected warm/cool or green/magenta direction were found at any of the six settings on either image.

## What an implementer must reproduce exactly

1. The two forward matrices (`RGB_TO_XYZ`, `XYZ_TO_LMS`) verbatim, and their inverses computed programmatically via 3×3 adjugate/determinant — never hard-coded separately-published inverse constants.
2. `D65_X = 0.3127`, `D65_Y = 0.3290` as the anchor; `D65_NOMINAL_CCT = 6504.0` as the locus-direction reference point only.
3. `K_T = 1.0375` (mired/unit, subtracted), `K_TINT = 0.00020` (uv-units/unit), the Kim et al. 2002 locus polynomial exactly as given, and the locked tangent/perpendicular sign (`(tv, -tu)`).
4. The explicit `temperature == 0.0 && tint == 0.0` special case returning the input/identity unchanged, in addition to (not instead of) the general formula proving `1e-12`.
5. Patch averaging in linear sRGB over up to 25 edge-clipped samples; the three rejection checks in the stated order (clipped on raw bytes, near-black on `Y < 0.02`, non-finite); the bounded 2-D Newton solver with `1e-6`/`64` and round-to-nearest-step; out-of-range reported, never clamped.
