//! The view: one file per region, each a pure function from a model to an `Element`. Nothing here
//! reads authoritative state, validates a parameter or calls the owner; the models carry everything
//! the screen shows, so a rendering change cannot change what the editor does.
//!
//! The five-region shell from the [Develop workspace design](../../../../docs/design/develop-workspace.md#layout):
//! a title bar, a middle row of the state panel, the canvas and the tools panel, and a status bar.
//! The two side panels collapse independently through the session's own workspace state; the canvas
//! takes whatever remains. Every region is styled from [`luxforge_ui::theme`], never an ad hoc
//! colour, and the window carries no outer padding: the canvas pads its photo itself.
