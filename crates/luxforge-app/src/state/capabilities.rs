//! Module capabilities as the desktop knows them, and the models its tools panel, notices and
//! evidence are derived from. Everything here is plain data: the owner's own answers
//! (`module.settings.read`, `module.status`, `job.read`, a `consent-required` failure), the
//! text a person is typing, and which sub-view of a section is open. Nothing here calls the owner,
//! and nothing decides what the host accepts: every value is validated by the core when it is sent.
//! The section is generated from the descriptor, so any module that declares settings, resources,
//! an activation or tasks gets the same surface.
