//! The histogram inspector's model: the plotted bins, the endpoint counters, the two clipping
//! triangles and their tooltips, the pointer readout's wording and the arithmetic that sizes the
//! clipping overlay.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of a [`Report`] the preview worker already produced. Nothing
//! reduces a raster, asks the owner for anything or draws: the plot's shared vertical scale, the
//! counter wording, the stale rule and the overlay's cell grid are all decided here so they can be
//! proved without a window, and the widgets are handed numbers they cannot reinterpret.
//!
//! The inspector is the plot with the two triangles inside its bottom corners, and nothing else: a
//! fixed height that never depends on the pointer, the analysis status or the counts, so nothing in
//! the tools panel moves while a slider is dragged, the pointer crosses the photograph or a frame is
//! re-analysed. Everything that varies lives where it cannot move a control. A status with no report
//! behind it is drawn inside the plot's own area ([`HistogramModel::notice`]); the endpoint counts
//! are the triangles' tooltips ([`HistogramModel::shadow_tooltip`],
//! [`HistogramModel::highlight_tooltip`]); and the pointer readout is in the status bar
//! ([`readout_text`]). The plot carries no caption, on hover or otherwise (owner, 2026-09-26).
//!
//! The described domain is fixed by the [histogram and clipping
//! contract](../../../../docs/design/basic-and-histogram.md#histogram-and-clipping-contract): the
//! rendered SDR sRGB **output** of the whole composition, after crop and edits, before any UI
//! overlay or display scaling. It is never the camera or RAW histogram.
