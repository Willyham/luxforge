//! The Masks panel model: the mask list, the open mask's component list, and the host controls the
//! two are edited through.
//!
//! Nothing is invented here. Every value comes from `mask.list`, every control is one the host
//! declares in [`luxforge_core::mask::commands::controls`], and every button that would be refused
//! by the command family carries that family's own reason instead of being offered — the design's
//! rule that the panel surfaces a refusal rather than presenting a button the host will reject. The
//! reasons are not re-derived here: each is the refusal [`luxforge_core::mask::rules`] returns for
//! the facts the listing reports, which is the same function the command refuses through, so the
//! limits, the leading-add rule and their wording live in the host alone.
//!
//! The adjustments that apply *through* a mask are not modelled here at all: they are the delivered
//! generated sections of the maskable modules, derived by [`super::tools`] with this panel's
//! selected mask as their target.
