//! The Performance section's model: what the state panel's last block says about this editor's own
//! memory, CPU and GPU use and its long-running work, derived from the `resources.read` and
//! `activity.list` answers the section's sampler collected (`docs/design/performance-panel.md`).
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of those answers. The counters are cumulative, so a rate
//! comes from two consecutive samples; values are formatted in Activity Monitor's units; each series
//! is normalised against its own scale rule; and the job rows follow the section's display rules.
//! Time enters only through the answers themselves — the monotonic clock each read was taken at and
//! the elapsed and ended times each board snapshot carries — so nothing here reads a clock and
//! every rule can be tested with made-up samples.
