//! The Performance section's sampler: the one-second read of `resources.read` and `activity.list`
//! behind the state panel's last block, and the gate that keeps it asleep.
//!
//! The section samples only while it is expanded **and** the state panel is on screen. Collapsed,
//! with the panel hidden or with the component gallery in its place, it sets no timer and makes no
//! request, so an idle editor stays asleep (performance rule 8). Whenever sampling starts, the
//! history is cleared and one read is sent at once rather than a second later; whenever it starts
//! or stops, the epoch moves, so a read that was in flight across the change is dropped when it
//! lands instead of being drawn into a window it does not belong to. At most one read is in flight:
//! a tick that finds one still out does nothing, so a slow owner stretches the interval rather than
//! queueing reads behind itself.
