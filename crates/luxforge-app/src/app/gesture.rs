//! The one gesture this client holds, and the driver that runs its core draft.
//!
//! A client holds at most one draft, so the desktop has exactly one place for it: [`Editor::gesture`].
//! A slider, a mask shape or stroke and the crop frame each draft through the core
//! ([`Gesture::Core`]) as one [`CoreDraft`] state machine with a small kind of its own, and a
//! discarded core draft whose owner round trip has not answered keeps the place
//! ([`Gesture::Closing`]), so the next gesture's `draft.begin` can never overtake the `draft.cancel`
//! of the last one. Whether anything may start is answered in one place, [`Editor::gesture_refusal`].
//!
//! The driver runs what the state machine answers: `draft.set` synchronously on this thread, in the
//! update that produced the fields ([performance rule 12](../../../../docs/engineering/performance-rules.md#rules)),
//! and `draft.begin`, `draft.commit`, `draft.cancel` and `draft.reapply` as owner tasks whose answers
//! come back as one [`DraftMessage`] family, each naming the gesture and draft it belongs to.
