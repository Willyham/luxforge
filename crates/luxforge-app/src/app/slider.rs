//! The slider gesture of a generated control. It holds no parameter knowledge of its own: which
//! action is drafted, which field it carries and what the value means all come from the descriptor
//! the control was generated from, so every module with a drafting control gets this gesture and no
//! module is named here.
//!
//! One gesture is one core draft, run by the shared driver in [`crate::app::gesture`]: the first
//! move opens it with `draft.begin` and sends its value in the same update, every later move offers
//! its value, which goes out with its one preview job at once, release commits once, Escape cancels, and an
//! external revision marks the draft conflicted until the Changed elsewhere notice is answered with
//! Discard or Reapply. What is here is only what a slider adds: the field it moves, the label the
//! status line names, and the double-click reset.
