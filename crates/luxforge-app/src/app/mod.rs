//! The Iced application: the editor's own state, the update function and the effects it starts.
//! Every change to authoritative state goes through an owner call; after each message the view
//! models whose inputs moved are derived again ([`state::Built`]), and the view renders those alone.
//!
//! This file holds the [`Editor`] state and the Iced entry points only. [`Message`] has one variant
//! per seam, each carrying that seam's own message enum (declared together in `message.rs`), and
//! `update` routes it to the seam's own update function: owner answers and sync (`sync.rs`),
//! preview presentation (`preview.rs`), the overlays (`overlay.rs`), history and versions
//! (`history.rs`), per-client view state (`view_state.rs`), the palette (`palette.rs`), generated
//! controls (`controls.rs`), declared actions (`actions.rs`), the pointer and canvas picks
//! (`pointer.rs`), crop (`crop.rs`), masks (`masks.rs`), the core-draft lifecycle (`gesture.rs`),
//! presets (`presets.rs`), capabilities (`capabilities.rs`), the Performance section
//! (`performance.rs`), export (`export.rs`) and evidence mode (`evidence.rs`). Routing is one match on the calling
//! thread: it adds no task and no runtime hop.
