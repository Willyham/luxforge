//! The shape editors: one per component kind this build draws, each owning everything about its
//! own kind that a gesture touches.
//!
//! A drawn kind's editor holds that kind's geometry and the gesture in flight over it, and answers
//! every question the draft, the canvas and the panel ask of a shape: its declared numbers, its
//! handles and where they sit, what a press, a drag and a sweep do, what a typed number is allowed
//! to be, which host method the release commits through and what the figure looks like. The draft
//! ([`super::MaskDraft`]) and the canvas ([`crate::mask_canvas`]) hold a [`DrawnShape`] and never ask
//! which kind it is: they call its [`ShapeEditor`], and the one place a kind is matched is
//! [`DrawnShape`]'s dereference below. Adding a drawn kind whose geometry is named numbers is one
//! module beside [`super::linear`], [`super::radial`] and [`super::brush`], one variant, one row of
//! [`DRAWN_KINDS`] and a [`MaskHandle`] variant for each new handle. A kind whose geometry is not
//! numbers, or whose gesture is neither a handle drag nor a paint, needs more: the editor's values
//! and fields are numbers and the canvas knows those two gestures (`docs/design/masking-workspace.md`,
//! "What a new kind still needs").
//!
//! Nothing here holds a framework type. A figure is described through a [`Pen`] in normalized
//! content coordinates and mask-space distances, and the canvas implements the pen, so a shape's
//! drawing is testable without a renderer and the canvas draws every kind with the same three
//! primitives.
