//! The brush's shape editor: the stroke being painted and the brush it is painted with.

//! A brush has no handles and no shape to reopen: its geometry is a path the pointer draws, and
//! every press on the photograph paints. So its editor holds the stroke in flight and the settings
//! of the brush in the hand, and commits all three of its edits through the one command that carries
//! a path — which of the three it is, is what the identities the draft names say.
