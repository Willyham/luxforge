//! The window's frame, decided in one place for every platform.
//!
//! On macOS the app's title bar is the window's: the native title bar is transparent, its title is
//! hidden and the content view fills the whole window, so the traffic lights sit inside the app's
//! own 44 pt bar, at its leading edge. The bar leaves them [`TITLE_BAR_LEADING`] and moves the
//! window when its empty area is pressed. Windows and Linux keep their native frames and title
//! bars, so the app's bar starts at the ordinary inset and never drags the window itself.
//!
//! AppKit places the traffic lights for a standard title bar, near the top of the window; they are
//! not centred on the taller bar, and nothing in Iced's window settings moves them.
