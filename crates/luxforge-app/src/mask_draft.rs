//! The transient mask shape draft: the single owner of everything a shape gesture changes before it
//! commits.
//!
//! This module holds no framework types and, unlike [`crate::crop_draft`], no stage raster either.
//! A mask component's geometry is stored in **content-stage normalized** coordinates — `x` and `y`
//! as fractions of the content stage, legal over
//! [`POSITION_MIN`][luxforge_core::mask::POSITION_MIN]`..=`[`POSITION_MAX`][luxforge_core::mask::POSITION_MAX]
//! — and that is the space this draft works in throughout. Mapping a pointer position into it is the
//! canvas's job, through `render.transform`'s affine and the canvas view, and it is done locally per
//! move rather than by asking the host ([performance rule 12](../../../docs/engineering/performance-rules.md)).
//!
//! The one number about the stage this draft does hold is its **aspect**, `W/H`, because mask space
//! is defined in terms of it: a stored distance is in units of the content stage's height on both
//! axes, so a circle stays a circle at any aspect ratio. It is read from the same one
//! `render.transform` answer the handles are mapped through, once per gesture, and never per move.
//!
//! What lives here is the draft itself — what the release targets and which command it commits — and
//! the map a pointer is placed through. Everything about one drawn kind's geometry — its handles, what
//! a press, a drag and a sweep do to it, what a typed number may be and what its figure looks like —
//! is that kind's [`editor::ShapeEditor`], in its own module beside this one, and the draft never asks which
//! kind it holds.
