//! The host's path primitives: the coordinate grid a drawn path is stored on, the decimation that
//! puts it there, the stroke a painting action captures, and the content-addressed store those
//! strokes live in.
//!
//! These are host primitives and nothing here is about any one feature that paints. A path is an
//! ordered list of positions in the content stage's normalized coordinates; a [`Stroke`] is such a
//! path with the brush settings it was drawn with; a [`StrokeId`] is the hash of a stroke's
//! canonical bytes. Any action that takes a drawn path declares a [`crate::ParameterKind::Points`]
//! parameter and stores its strokes here. Two designs already want exactly this — the component
//! that paints coverage and the repair operations that paint a region — so it is declared once,
//! beside the recipe, rather than twice inside the features that use it.
//!
//! **Why a store at all.** Every history entry stores a complete recipe rather than a delta
//! ([history](../../docs/specs/edit-history.md), [rule 10](../../docs/engineering/performance-rules.md#rules)),
//! and one stroke is one entry, so a payload that embedded its stroke list would copy every earlier
//! stroke of that list into every later entry. Storing each stroke once under its hash and
//! referencing it by that hash leaves the *shape* of the growth alone — an entry still holds one
//! reference per stroke, so the total is still quadratic in the stroke count — and shrinks its
//! constant from the serialized size of a stroke to the serialized size of a reference: 968 bytes
//! to 35 on the measured shape, a factor of about 28. It is not linear and this file claims nothing
//! of the sort; the hash-chain variant that would be linear is recorded in the design and is not
//! built.
//!
//! **What a reference costs to use.** An entry stays a full snapshot: resolving one takes one
//! lookup per referenced stroke and replays nothing, so previewing, undoing, redoing and restoring
//! are what they were, and the history graph, its branches and its named versions are untouched.
//!
//! **What a broken reference does.** A reference the store does not hold, or whose stored bytes do
//! not hash to the reference, is incompatible data exactly as an unavailable effect is: it is
//! retained byte for byte, it keeps reading, listing and undoing working, and every path that would
//! *draw* the recipe — rendering, sampling, and the export that will compile the same way — refuses
//! it by name. It is never resolved to an empty stroke, because an empty stroke is a picture that
//! silently lost part of an edit.
