//! The host's only network path: endpoint classification, resolution checks, redirects, limits and
//! TLS. See `docs/design/module-capabilities.md#transport`.
//!
//! A request connects directly to an address it checked, over this module's own socket and TLS
//! session; `ureq-proto` only writes the request and frames the response on that connection. Proxy
//! settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `ALL_PROXY` environment variables, are
//! deliberately ignored: a proxy would choose the address after the check and could read or
//! rewrite the request.
