//! The capability worker: two lanes, `transfer` (resource installs and removals) and `module`
//! (activation, deactivation and, later, tasks). Each lane is one thread, spawned on its first job,
//! that blocks on its channel while idle, runs one job at a time and posts the result into the
//! catalog owner's own channel; nothing polls. The owner keeps each lane's waiting jobs itself, at
//! most [`LANE_QUEUE`] of them, so a queued job can be cancelled or superseded without touching the
//! thread, and it keeps at most [`FINISHED_RECORDS`] finished records. Progress travels the other
//! way through a [`JobControl`] the worker writes and the owner reads when a client asks.
