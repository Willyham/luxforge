//! How a render samples a compiled mask.
//!
//! A mask's geometry is stored normalized to the content stage, so the mask compiled against a
//! proxy stage is the *same* coverage field at a smaller scale. That is what keeps a masked recipe
//! [proxy eligible](../../docs/design/instant-preview.md) by construction: nothing about the
//! equation changes with the stage, and a proxy render of a masked stack is the exact recipe at
//! proxy size.
//!
//! The one thing that does change with the stage is **sampling**. Coverage is read once per pixel,
//! at that pixel's centre, so a feature narrower than a pixel falls between the samples and aliases
//! — a hard-edged radial, whose ramp is zero pixels wide at every stage, is the extreme case. At
//! full resolution that is the frozen behaviour the [mask study](../../docs/design/mask-study.md)
//! settled and `render.sample` agrees with byte for byte. At proxy size the same field is sampled
//! on a grid two to four times coarser, and the recorded default (proposal P5 of
//! [masking](../../docs/design/masking.md#point-queries-and-proxies)) is to supersample **the mask
//! field only** — never the effect — 2 × 2 per pixel and say the frame is approximate.
//!
//! [`MaskField`] is that decision, made once when a layer's mask is compiled and read per pixel by
//! the colour run and the spatial tiling. It holds the compiled mask the render samples and, when
//! the thin-feature rule fired, the *same mask compiled against a stage of twice the width and
//! height*. That second compilation is not a second equation: pixel `(2x, 2y)` of a doubled stage
//! has its centre at `u = (2x + 0.5) / 2H = (x + 0.25) / H`, so the four doubled-stage pixels over
//! one stage pixel are exactly the four 2 × 2 subsample positions of that pixel in the mask's own
//! space. The mathematics [`CompiledMask`] froze is untouched; only where it is asked changes.
//!
//! Cost: one extra `O(components)` compilation per thin mask at plan time, and four coverage
//! evaluations per covered pixel instead of one, on the proxy frame alone — which is at most eight
//! megapixels by the proxy's own clamp, and only inside the mask's bounds.
