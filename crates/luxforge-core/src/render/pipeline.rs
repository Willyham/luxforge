//! The one pipeline, generic over its pixel domain.
//!
//! A recipe compiles into segments separated by stage boundaries (a resample or a spatial
//! operation), and every segment is its exact geometry, point replacements and colour runs. What a
//! pixel *is* between those steps is the only thing that differs between a JPEG and a developed
//! RAW, and [`PixelDomain`] is where that difference lives:
//!
//! - **Byte** ([`super::Byte`]): 8-bit sRGB with alpha. Each colour run decodes through the sRGB
//!   table, runs its units and quantizes at the run's end, so a point replacement, a resample and
//!   the end of the recipe are quantization boundaries, as is a spatial operation's output.
//! - **Linear** ([`super::linear::Linear`]): signed unbounded `f64` linear sRGB, with the RAW
//!   exposure and approximate white balance applied to each source pixel. A colour segment is `f32`
//!   from its entry to its end, nothing is quantized before the terminal boundary, and there is no
//!   alpha.
//!
//! Everything else exists once, here: walking a point back through the segments ([`Evaluation`]),
//! the resample recursion, a spatial entry answered from the query's tiles or from a materialized
//! frame, the global estimates a spatial entry reads and its output built tile by tile
//! ([`SpatialEntry`], [`spatial_entry`], which both drivers materialize a spatial operation
//! through), the replacements and colour runs applied to rows of a segment's output
//! ([`segment_pass`]) and the terminal conversion a sample and a grid share. The rectangle a
//! resample reads is [`super::Resample::reads`], beside the resample's own mapping.
//!
//! What stays with each domain's rasterizer is which frames it materializes. The byte driver
//! ([`super::rasterize`]) writes every segment's output as a byte frame, because a byte frame is
//! exactly what the next boundary reads. The linear driver ([`super::linear::rasterize`]) writes
//! only the last segment's rows and pulls everything before them through [`Evaluation`], because a
//! linear value between two boundaries is an `f64` the next resample blends: materializing it as
//! `f32` would change bytes and as `f64` would double the RAW planar bound. It pulls a bounded
//! rectangle at a time ([`Evaluation::region_in`]) — a spatial operation's input one row at a
//! time, a resample's taps one block at a time — so the colour before a boundary still runs over
//! rows. A spatial operation's output is `f32` on both paths, so the linear driver materializes
//! those, as a render always has.
