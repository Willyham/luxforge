//! The state a render reads besides its source and its recipe: the colour scratch budget, the
//! spatial budget and the store of prepared global estimates, with their high-water marks.
//!
//! None of it is process-global. One [`RenderContext`] is created by whoever owns the evaluations
//! that should share it — the editor service, and through it the catalog owner, the preview jobs
//! and the analysis jobs it plans — and every render receives it by reference. Two renders that
//! share a context share its budgets, which is what paces a render that overlaps another; two that
//! do not share nothing, which is what lets a test measure one render alone.
