//! A windowed proxy: the proxy of a cropped stack holds only the part of its stage the output reads.
//!
//! The proxy phase fits the recipe's *output* stage into the display bounds, so a tight crop raises
//! the proxy scale towards one and a whole-stage proxy towards the source's own size. Nothing
//! outside what the crop reads ever reaches the output, though, so a proxy compiled against the
//! whole proxy stage — the stage the proxy scale defines, which is what every normalized payload,
//! mask and spatial radius is resolved against — can be evaluated over a window of that stage
//! instead: the rectangle the output reads, walked back through every segment, plus the margins
//! each boundary needs.
//!
//! [`WindowPlan::of`] is that walk, over a compilation against the whole proxy stage, in
//! `O(segments)` with no pixel read. [`WindowPlan::apply`] rewrites the same compilation so that it
//! reads a source of the window's dimensions and keeps only each segment's window of its output:
//!
//! - **The source.** The first segment's composed geometry is preceded by the translation that
//!   places the window at its origin in the proxy stage, so every output pixel reads the source
//!   pixel it read before, now at the window's coordinates.
//! - **A segment whose output a boundary reads** keeps only the rectangle that boundary reads: an
//!   exact crop to it is appended to its operations and to its composed geometry. A masked colour
//!   operation maps its frame coordinate back through the exact steps after it, which now include
//!   that crop, so its mask is read at the same stage pixel as before. A segment holding a
//!   positional unit (a finish-stage layer, whose units read the output coordinates they are handed)
//!   or a point replacement is never cut, and a stack that would need it has no window.
//! - **A resample** reads the previous segment's window: its continuous input coordinate is
//!   translated by the window's integer origin after the resample's own arithmetic, which is exact in
//!   `f64` (an integer subtracted from a non-negative coordinate below 2^52 is representable), so
//!   every tap is the same pixel with the same weight. The window holds every tap the output reads
//!   plus [`TAP_MARGIN`] pixels, or reaches the stage edge where a tap is clamped to it.
//! - **A spatial operation** runs over the previous segment's window as its own stage: the rectangle
//!   the next segment reads, grown by the operation's summed halo and clamped to the stage, with its
//!   origin moved down to the [`SPATIAL_TILE`] grid. Every unit is tile invariant over tiles anchored
//!   at the stage origin (the [`crate::modules::SpatialUnit`] contract), and a window whose origin is
//!   on that grid holds exactly the stage's own tiles, so every pixel the next segment reads is the
//!   value the whole stage gives it. Its radii are the ones it was compiled with, against the whole
//!   proxy stage. Its mask is compiled against the whole stage and read at the window's offset. What
//!   the window cannot hold is a whole-stage reduction, so an operation that prepares a global
//!   estimate is handed the estimate prepared for the **exact** stage, which the exact phase of the
//!   same job reads from the store; that is part of why a spatial proxy frame is approximate, which it
//!   already reports. An operation with an estimate behind another spatial operation would need the
//!   exact render of the first to prepare it, so such a stack has no window.
//!
//! Everything else — the colour arithmetic, the masks, the finish units of the last segment, the
//! quantization — is untouched, so a windowed proxy frame is byte for byte the proxy frame of the
//! whole proxy stage, which is itself the exact recipe over the exact downscale (for a stack without
//! a spatial operation; with one, the same frame as the whole stage rendered with the exact stage's
//! estimates). The tests below and in `preview::tests` prove both.
