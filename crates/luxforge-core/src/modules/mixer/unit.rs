//! The colour mixer's one pointwise unit.
//!
//! This is the production transcription of the equations frozen in
//! `docs/design/mixer-study.md`: the eight range centres, the monotone hue warp the hue sliders
//! drive, the raised-cosine weights the saturation and luminance sliders are distributed by, the
//! chroma ramp, the chroma factor and the Oklab `L` gamma response, composed hue then chroma then
//! luminance from amounts evaluated once on the **input** pixel. The study is the only place the
//! justifications live; this file restates the constants and nothing else.
//!
//! The Oklab conversion is **not** restated here: it is the one accepted in
//! `docs/design/basic-colour.md` and implemented in [`crate::colour::oklab`], reused unchanged so
//! every colour-adjusting module shares it rather than restating the matrices; that conversion
//! also gives an achromatic result three bit-identical channels.
//!
//! Coefficients are computed in f64 — the frozen centres, the eight gaps derived from them, the
//! hue warp's knots, slopes and per-segment cubics, and the sixteen saturation and luminance
//! amounts — and cast once into the small fixed-size f32 arrays the unit holds. The per-pixel path
//! is f32 throughout, ignores the row coordinates and touches nothing but the pixel it was given
//! and those arrays.
