//! Texture: the medium-frequency luminance band, isolated as the difference of two self-guided
//! edge-preserving smoothers of the encoded luminance, scaled by the compressive gain and
//! reapplied.
//!
//! ```text
//! E     = encode(luminance(rgb))
//! F     = guided_self(E, r_fine,   EPS_TEXTURE)
//! C     = guided_self(E, r_coarse, EPS_TEXTURE)
//! band  = F - C
//! delta = soft_clip(gain_texture(amount) * band, E, LIMIT_TEXTURE)
//! out   = reconstruct(rgb, L, decode(E + delta))
//! ```
//!
//! Frozen in `docs/design/presence-study.md` and transcribed in `f64` at
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/presence.rs`. Structure finer than `r_fine` survives both
//! smoothers and cancels in the difference; structure coarser than `r_coarse` is reproduced by both
//! and cancels too; a strong edge drives both filters' `a` toward 1, so both reproduce it and the
//! band collapses there, which is what keeps the overshoot bounded.
