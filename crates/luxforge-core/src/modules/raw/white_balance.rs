//! Temperature/tint white balance for prepared camera-channel data.
//!
//! The returned gains are sensor multipliers: they are applied before demosaicing and are
//! normalized so green is exactly one. `cam_xyz` is the four-by-three LibRaw matrix whose first
//! three rows map XYZ to camera responses. The fourth row is intentionally ignored because this
//! helper only supports three developed camera channels.
//!
//! Temperature uses a documented blackbody/daylight locus approximation. The blackbody equations
//! cover the lower part of Luxforge's range, the daylight equations cover the upper part, and a
//! smooth transition keeps the two approximations continuous around their seam. Tint is an
//! explicit Luxforge unit: one unit is 1e-4 signed CIE 1960 `uv` distance (`Duv`). The
//! user-facing positive direction is magenta: it moves the assumed illuminant toward +Duv (the
//! green side), so the compensating sensor gains make a calibrated neutral more magenta.
//!
//! Provenance: RawTherapee's White Balance technical notes document the blackbody/daylight split
//! and its temperature ranges; the CIE 1960 `uv` coordinates define the signed locus offset.
//! LibRaw's API data structure and `cam_xyz_coeff` implementation establish the XYZ-to-camera row
//! direction used here. Nothing here serializes an AsShot temperature: the payload keeps the
//! camera's gains, and [`temperature_tint_from_gains`] answers which temperature and tint would
//! reproduce them, for a client to show.
