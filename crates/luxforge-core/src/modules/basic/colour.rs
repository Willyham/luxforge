//! The Basic module's colour unit: `ColourAdjust`, fusing Vibrance and Saturation, sharing the
//! Oklab conversion frozen in `docs/design/basic-colour.md` and the independent f64 reference at
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/colour.rs`. Both parameters scale Oklab `a`/`b` about
//! the achromatic axis and leave `L` untouched; neither clamps internally, per the design's gamut
//! policy. Vibrance's gain and saturation's gain compose into one factor before either is applied,
//! so one pixel converts to Oklab and back exactly once instead of once per parameter — the two
//! parameters are mathematically independent scalings of the same `(a, b)` pair around the same
//! axis with `L` untouched, so composing their gains before scaling changes no arithmetic on
//! `a`/`b` itself; only the number of round trips through the independently rounded inverse
//! matrices changes (see `colour_adjust_matches_the_sequential_pair_within_the_frozen_tolerance`
//! below for the measured difference this makes). This file never imports the reference's colour
//! module: the two are written independently so they never share a bug. Its tests decode an sRGB
//! byte to linear light through `luxforge_reference::srgb`, the one shared sRGB oracle, which is
//! not part of that comparison.
