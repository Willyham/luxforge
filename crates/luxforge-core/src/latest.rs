//! One persistent worker that runs the newest job: the primitive behind the preview, the histogram
//! analysis and the desktop's clipping overlay.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A [`Latest`] owns one thread for its whole life. The thread sleeps on a condition variable until
//! a job is handed to it, runs it, and takes the next job **itself** the moment the run returns, so
//! a job that waited never waits for the consumer to ask. At most one job runs and at most one
//! waits: a newer [`Latest::request`] replaces the waiting job, which never starts and delivers
//! nothing, and the request hands it back so the caller learns that it ended. Every job is tagged
//! with a generation, and so is every result it produces. Results reach the consumer through
//! [`Latest::poll`]; the worker calls the consumer's waker once per result, on the worker thread,
//! so nothing wakes on a timer to ask whether something has finished.
//!
//! # Delivery
//!
//! Results are delivered in the order they were produced, which is generation order: jobs run one
//! at a time and a waiting job is always newer than the running one. A result is delivered unless
//! [`Latest::cancel`] has since raised the floor to or above its generation. Nothing else makes a
//! result stale: a job that finished after a newer request still produced the newest result the
//! consumer has not seen, and dropping it is what starves a drag of frames. A consumer that wants
//! only the newest request's result filters by generation itself.
//!
//! # Tokens
//!
//! A running job reads two [`Cancel`] tokens, which say what has happened to it since it was handed
//! to the worker:
//!
//! - **superseded** is raised when a newer job is requested. The job is no longer the newest one,
//!   but whatever it still produces is delivered. Work that is only worth finishing while it is the
//!   newest stops on it.
//! - **abandoned** is raised by [`Latest::cancel`], by [`Latest::withdraw`] of this job, and when
//!   the worker is dropped. Nobody wants anything more from it. Abandoning a job also supersedes it,
//!   so work that stops on `superseded` stops on abandonment too. A job abandoned before the worker
//!   takes it never starts.
//!
//! The preview's two phases are why there are two. Its proxy phase stops only when abandoned: a
//! newer request does not interrupt it, because its display-size frame is still newer than anything
//! on screen and interrupting it is what starves a drag. Its exact phase stops when superseded: a
//! full-resolution render of a value the pointer has already left would only compete for the shared
//! Rayon pool with the proxy render of the newer one. An analysis stops only when abandoned, because
//! a newer request for another image does not make the running one worthless to the client that
//! asked for it.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! One thread, one running job, one waiting job, and at most [`WAITING_RESULTS`] results waiting
//! for the consumer. A job with another result to hand over while that many wait holds on to it
//! until the consumer takes one — or until the result becomes stale, which drops it — so a
//! consumer that stops polling holds the worker back instead of letting results pile up. A job
//! that panics delivers nothing more, and the worker lives on to run the next one. Dropping the
//! [`Latest`] abandons the running job and ends the thread once that job returns; nothing joins it.
