/// source and caching it all happen on the worker.
///
/// # What is delivered
///
/// A completed result is delivered whenever it is newer than what the display already has, not
/// only when it belongs to the newest request. Under a sustained drag a render almost always
/// finishes after a newer job has been requested, so dropping every superseded result presents no
/// frames at all. The rule is therefore a floor and a monotone order:
///
/// - [`Self::cancel`] raises the floor to the generation it returns, so everything in flight at
///   that moment is stale. It is the only thing that invalidates an in-flight result, which is what
///   an asset or selection change needs.
/// - [`Self::poll`] delivers results in the order the worker produced them, which is
///   `(generation, phase)` order: jobs run one at a time and a pending job is always newer than the
///   active one, so an older frame never follows a newer one on screen and a job's exact phase
///   follows its own proxy phase.
/// - An exact phase that answered [`ErrorKind::Cancelled`] carries no frame, and is delivered all
///   the same, under the same rules, as that outcome ([`PreviewResult::cancelled`]). So every job
///   that starts delivers exactly one exact-phase outcome above the floor — a frame, a failure or
///   cancelled — and a caller waiting for one generation learns when it has ended.
///
/// Newest-wins survives where it belongs: a newer request replaces the pending job, so at most one
/// job waits and the newest value is the one that runs next. A replaced job never starts and has
/// nothing to deliver; [`Self::request_replacing`] names it.
///
/// # The two phases and the two tokens
///
/// The proxy phase reads the job's **abandoned** token and the exact phase its **superseded** one
/// ([`crate::latest`]). A newer request supersedes the active job, which stops its exact phase —
/// nothing is waiting for that full-resolution frame, and it would compete for the Rayon pool with
/// the render that replaced it — but leaves its proxy phase running, because that frame is still
/// newer than what is on screen and stopping it is what starves a drag. [`Self::cancel`] abandons
/// the job, which stops both.
///
/// # When the next job starts
///
/// The worker takes the pending job itself as soon as the active one has handed over its exact
/// phase, so the next proxy render never waits for the consumer to poll.
