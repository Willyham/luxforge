//! The mask coverage overlay: one mask's composed coverage as a bounded display-cell grid.
//!
//! The [masking design](../../../docs/design/masking.md)'s overlay is "one byte per display cell on
//! the grid the clipping overlay already defines and bounds", and this is that grid. It reuses
//! [`cell_pixel`](super::overlay::cell_pixel) — the delivered clipping overlay's own cell
//! arithmetic — and the delivered [`MAX_OVERLAY_CELLS`] bound rather than inventing a second grid,
//! so the two overlays address the same cells of the same frame and cannot drift apart.
//!
//! **Nothing full-resolution is allocated, at any stage size.** The clipping overlay must walk every
//! pixel, because one clipped pixel among millions has to survive a Fit reduction. A coverage field
//! has no such isolated feature to rescue: it is continuous, and the honest display-sized answer is
//! the field *sampled* once per cell. So this reduction is `O(cells × components)` and never
//! `O(pixels)`, it holds one byte per cell and nothing else, and the buffer is bounded by
//! [`MAX_OVERLAY_CELLS`] a side whatever the frame behind it is. That is the same rule
//! [`CompiledMask`] itself is written to — no mask plane is ever materialized ([performance rules 4
//! and 6](../../../docs/engineering/performance-rules.md#rules)) — restated for the display.
//!
//! **The grid describes the frame it arrived with.** A mask is compiled against the *content* stage
//! its layer receives, and the frame is the *output* stage after the geometry tail, so a cell is
//! answered by mapping its own output pixel's centre back through the tail's one affine
//! ([`StageTransform`]) and asking [`CompiledMask::coverage`] about the content pixel that lands in.
//! That is the same coordinate convention and the same rounding `render.locate` walks, so the
//! overlay and a pick agree about which content pixel an output pixel holds.
//!
//! **A value-based component is answered on the pixel the masked operation receives.** Such a
//! component's coverage is a function of that pixel and not of position, and the frame the grid
//! describes holds that operation's *output*, so the input is supplied by the caller as
//! [`MaskPixels::Input`] — the recipe prefix up to the mask's first bound layer, evaluated once per
//! grid cell (proposal P16 of `docs/design/range-study.md`, decided by the owner on 2026-09-23). A
//! caller with no operation to read one from says so instead, and the grid is refused by name.
