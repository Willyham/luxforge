//! Analysis job identity, the owner-held result store and the bounded analysis worker.
//!
//! The reducer in the parent module is a pure function over a rendered raster. This module is what
//! turns it into a service: an identity that says exactly which evaluated image a report belongs
//! to, a bounded store the catalog owner keeps, and one worker with a single active job and a
//! single replaceable pending job, as the integration contract's "Analysis jobs and identity"
//! requires (`docs/design/basic-and-histogram.md`).
//!
//! Nothing here runs on the catalog owner thread except bookkeeping: building a job costs a state
//! read, a cached source verification and an `O(layers)` plan and compile. The render and the
//! reduction happen on the worker, which wakes the owner through its own channel, so no timer and
//! no polling loop is involved.
