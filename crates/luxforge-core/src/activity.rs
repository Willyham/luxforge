//! The host's activity board: the long-running work in progress now, and the work that finished
//! recently.
//!
//! A worker whose work a person or an agent may be waiting on — preparing an original, developing a
//! RAW, rendering a preview, measuring a histogram — calls `ActivityBoard::begin` and holds the
//! `Activity` it gets back for as long as the work runs. A reader takes an [`ActivitySnapshot`],
//! which is the `activity.list` answer. Publishers and readers share the board's schema and nothing
//! else, so the panel that shows the work knows no worker and no worker knows the panel
//! (`docs/design/performance-panel.md`).
//!
//! The board holds current state rather than a stream of events. A reader that arrives late needs to
//! know what is running now, not the transitions it missed, and preview jobs start and finish at the
//! display's rate during a drag, which would evict the catalog mutations the event log exists for.
//! [`ActivitySnapshot::sequence`] changes whenever the contents change, so a poller can skip an
//! unchanged snapshot.
//!
//! Everything here is bounded and cheap: at most `MAX_ACTIVE` active and `MAX_RECENT` recent
//! entries, both stored in lists sized once when the board is made, one uncontended mutex per call,
//! and no timer, thread or queue.
