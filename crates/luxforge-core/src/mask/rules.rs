//! The `mask.*` commands refuse through these functions, and a client that wants to say *before* a
//! click why a control is not offered calls the same functions with the same facts from its listing —
//! a mask's name and component count, a component's mode and position, a stroke or sample count,
//! whether a layer is bound to the mask. So what a panel states and what the command answers are one
//! rule in one spelling, by construction rather than by a second copy kept in step: a client that
//! sends the command anyway gets exactly the sentence the panel showed. None of them reads a pixel, a
//! recipe or the catalog; each is `O(1)` or `O(components)`.
