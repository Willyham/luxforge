//! The `luminance-range` and `colour-range` component kinds: the frozen range selections of
//! `docs/design/range-study.md`, compiled against the content stage their mask's layer receives.
//!
//! This file is the production transcription of that study and of the independent `f64` reference at
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/range.rs`. The per-pixel expressions are written in the
//! reference's form and the reference's order, so coverage is bit-identical to it rather than merely
//! within tolerance: `lo`, `hi`, `lo_feather`, `hi_feather`, each sample's Oklab `(a, b)` pair and
//! the refine radius are hoisted to compile time because they do not depend on the pixel, the
//! feathers and the radius stay **divisors** rather than becoming precomputed reciprocals, there is
//! no fused multiply-add and no reassociated dot product or matrix product, [`smooth`] is not folded
//! into Horner's form, and the `+ 1` of a shoulder is not folded into its numerator.
//!
//! **These two kinds read a value, not a position.** Everything else in this module answers
//! `coverage(u, v)` from the pixel's position alone; a range selection answers from the **pixel the
//! operation it modulates receives**, which is what [`super::CompiledMask::coverage`] carries as its
//! `rgb` argument (proposal P12 of the study, decided there). Three consequences are stated rather
//! than hidden, and each has its own answer below: the conservative rectangle is the whole stage
//! ([`value_support`]), the smallest feature is `f64::INFINITY` because no pixel grid resolves a
//! value test ([`value_feature_px`]), and what such a component selects moves when a layer ahead of
//! it changes the operation's input.
//!
//! **Why the arithmetic is `f64` and not `f32`.** The study derives a coverage tolerance from the
//! shoulder's Lipschitz constant precisely because a pixel is computed in `f32` by a render and in
//! `f64` by the reference. This unit removes that gap instead of living inside it: the incoming
//! `[f32; 3]` is widened once, at the top of [`super::CompiledMask::evaluate`], and every expression
//! after it is the reference's own `f64` expression. The whole coverage field is already `f64` — the
//! mask study froze it that way — so nothing is paid for this that the geometric components were not
//! already paying, and the result is exact equality with the oracle instead of a bound.
//!
//! The luminance axis and the Oklab conversion are the **delivered** ones, read from the Basic
//! module's own `f64` constants rather than copied here, so the editor keeps one definition of
//! luminance and one colour space.
