//! The `mask.*` host command family: what each command declares, what it does to a recipe's mask
//! table, and the history label it commits.
//!
//! Masks are the host's own objects, not a tool module (`docs/design/masking.md#host-commands`): a
//! module commits *layers* through [`crate::ActionPlan`] and must never rewrite the recipe, while
//! every one of these commands rewrites the mask table beside the layers. Everything else about them
//! is a module action's, and deliberately the *same* code rather than a parallel copy of it:
//!
//! - The family is published as one **host descriptor** ([`descriptor`], `luxforge.masks`) in the
//!   same [`ModuleDescriptor`] shape a module's is, listed by `module.list` under `host`: its actions
//!   are the commands, its queries `mask.list` and `mask.sample-input`, its controls the panel's
//!   widgets. An agent discovers a mask command exactly as it discovers a module action.
//! - A command is resolved as [`crate::ActionRef::Host`] by the registry's one action lookup,
//!   checked by the same [`crate::check_parameters`] and planned and committed through the editor's
//!   one action path (`EditorService::run_action`), so the envelope, the deduplication, the
//!   revision, the admission, the single history entry and a draft's equality with its commit are
//!   the delivered ones and not a second implementation.
//! - The mask, component and stroke a command addresses are declared parameters of the identity
//!   kind, and a rename's name one of the string kind, so every one is validated and deduplicated
//!   like any other parameter. [`MaskTarget`] is those four fields as a client or a draft holds
//!   them.
//!
//! **The geometry methods are generated per component kind**, as `edit.<action>` and `query.<id>`
//! already are: `mask.create-linear`, `mask.add-radial`, `mask.set-linear` and so on, each declaring
//! exactly the parameters its own kind's module declares. One `mask.create` carrying a `kind` and a
//! union of every kind's fields cannot be declared honestly — the closed parameter vocabulary has no
//! way to say "these parameters when the kind is linear, those when it is radial", so `schema.list`
//! would advertise a radius on a linear gradient and a client would have to read prose to know
//! better. Generating from [`super::COMPONENT_KINDS`] also means a kind becomes creatable, addable
//! and patchable by being *registered*, rather than by someone remembering a second table: this
//! module declares no geometry of its own and knows no kind by name.
