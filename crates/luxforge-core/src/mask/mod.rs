//! The host's compiled mask: what one pixel's coverage is, where coverage can be non-zero at all,
//! and the table of component kinds this build can evaluate.
//!
//! A mask is a host object in the recipe rather than a module's state
//! (`docs/design/masking.md`), so compiling one lives here beside the module registry and not inside
//! any module. A [`CompiledMask`] is built from a stored [`Mask`] and the [`Stage`] its layer
//! receives, and it is **pure**: coverage at a pixel is a function of that pixel's position, that
//! pixel's own value and the stored payloads, and of nothing else. That is what lets a rasterizing
//! pass and `render.sample` agree by construction rather than by care — both reach it through the
//! same call with the same arguments.
//!
//! **The pixel is the second argument, and it is the input of the operation the mask modulates**
//! (proposal P12 of `docs/design/range-study.md`, decided there). A geometric component ignores it
//! and is bit-identical across the change; a range selection is answerable from nothing else, and a
//! second entry point for it would double the contract for one argument. What the value-based kinds
//! then cost — a whole-stage rectangle, no thin-feature supersample, and a selection that moves when
//! a layer ahead of it is reordered — is stated in [`range`] and in the user guide rather than
//! hidden.
//!
//! Transcription. This file is the production transcription of the frozen mathematics in
//! `docs/design/mask-study.md` and of the independent `f64` reference at
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs`; the three must be read together, and every
//! expression on the per-pixel path is written in the same form and the same order as the
//! reference's, so coverage is not merely within tolerance of it but **bit-identical** for the same
//! payloads, stage and pixel. The study's rule that makes that checkable is that any value which
//! does not depend on the pixel may be precomputed and no arithmetic on the per-pixel path may be
//! rewritten: so `amount / 100`, the aspect ratio and each component's own compile-time terms are
//! hoisted here, and there is no fused multiply-add, no reassociated dot product, no precomputed
//! reciprocal in place of a division, no Horner-form [`smooth`], and no component inversion folded
//! into a falloff instead of the one `1 - c` the composition performs.
//!
//! Two spellings of the mask-space map are frozen and are not interchangeable. This unit uses the
//! **pixel-centre** spelling — `u = (px + 0.5) / H`, `v = (py + 0.5) / H` — because it answers for a
//! pixel of the stage it was compiled against; compiling a stored payload uses the **stored
//! position** spelling, `u = x · W/H`, `v = y`. They agree to `2.220e-16` and differ in their last
//! bits, so mixing them would cost bit-identity while staying within tolerance.
//!
//! Memory. Nothing here scales with the stage's area: a compiled mask holds one entry per component
//! and no mask plane is ever allocated, at any size. That is the point-query rule
//! (`docs/engineering/performance-rules.md`), not an optimization — a mask that could not be
//! answered for one pixel in bounded time would make a sampled byte unable to equal a rendered one.
