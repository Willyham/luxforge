//! The `brush` component kind: the frozen brush of `docs/design/mask-study.md#the-brush`, compiled
//! against the content stage its mask's layer receives.
//!
//! This file is the production transcription of that block and of the `brush_coverage`,
//! `stroke_coverage`, `segment_distance2` and `capsule_profile` functions of the independent `f64`
//! reference at `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs`. The per-pixel expressions are
//! written in the reference's form and the reference's order, so coverage is bit-identical to it
//! rather than merely within tolerance: a stroke's `R`, `band`, `hard` and `amount` and each
//! segment's `ax, ay, ex, ey, len2` are hoisted to compile time because they do not depend on the
//! pixel, `len2` and `band` stay **divisors** rather than becoming precomputed reciprocals, the
//! square root is taken once per stroke and not once per segment, and neither fold is rewritten into
//! its algebraically equal twin.
//!
//! **What a brush component holds.** Its strokes, in order, as content addresses into the host's
//! [stroke store](crate::path). The payload carries the reserved [`crate::path::STROKES_FIELD`] and
//! nothing else: **no coordinate is ever written into a component payload**, because every history
//! entry stores a complete recipe and a payload that embedded its points would copy every earlier
//! stroke into every later entry. A reference the store cannot answer is refused by name where the
//! recipe is compiled, never resolved to an empty stroke.
//!
//! **Why maximum along a stroke and screen union across strokes.** One pass of the brush has one
//! density whatever the pointer's sampling rate: coverage is a function of the path, not of how fast
//! the hand moved or of how many positions the desktop posted. A second pass is a second object and
//! does build up — that is the difference between a stroke and a component, and it is why the
//! per-stroke rule is a maximum while the across-stroke rule is a union.
//!
//! **Why the strokes are stored in order.** Add strokes combine by screen union, which is
//! commutative, so removing one is well defined; an erase stroke does not commute with an add, and
//! the order is where that lives.
//!
//! **Why a grid index.** A point query must be answerable in bounded time and must never rasterize
//! ([performance rule 4](../../../docs/engineering/performance-rules.md)). The index over segments is
//! what makes the cost of a pixel depend on the strokes *near it* rather than on how many strokes the
//! component holds. The occupancy cap that bounds a pixel's cost is checked **where a stroke is
//! painted** ([`densest_cell`], called by `mask.add-stroke`), against the content stage the mask is
//! drawn on: a stroke that would cross it is refused before it commits, so every committed
//! component is already within it and compiling one never refuses for occupancy.
//!
//! Compiling uses the **stored position** spelling of mask space (`u = x · W/H`, `v = y`); the
//! per-pixel path receives the pixel-centre spelling from [`super::CompiledMask`]. The two agree to
//! `2.220e-16` and not bit for bit, so each is used only where the study froze it.
