//! The shapes a component kind's declared geometry parameters take.
//!
//! A component kind declares its own [`ParameterDescriptor`]s once, in its own module beside the
//! parser that range-checks the same numbers (`docs/design/masking.md#host-commands`). This file
//! holds the handful of shapes those declarations are built from, so the legal range a parser
//! enforces and the range a generated control offers are one constant read twice and never two that
//! could drift.
//!
//! Every shape is a [`crate::ParameterKind::Number`] with the kind's own bound, plus the display
//! hints a generated number field needs to be usable: a `step` a key press moves by, a `fine_step`
//! for the modifier, the `precision` a field shows, and the `soft_min`/`soft_max` a slider spans
//! when the legal range is wider than the range a person works in. A hint is a hint: the host
//! validates it is finite and positive and stores it, and never rounds a request to it.
//!
//! Each precision is the fewest decimals that still show the shape's `step`, so a field reads the
//! way a person writes the number — `0.52`, `0.180`, `−12`, `60` — and a key press always changes
//! what it shows. A fine nudge below the precision is still sent and stored exactly, and the field
//! shows the extra digits while the value carries them.
