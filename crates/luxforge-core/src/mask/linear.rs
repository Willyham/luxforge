//! The `linear` component kind: the frozen linear gradient of
//! `docs/design/mask-study.md#the-linear-gradient`, compiled against the content stage its mask's
//! layer receives.
//!
//! This file is the production transcription of that block and of the `linear_coverage` function of
//! the independent `f64` reference at `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs`. The
//! per-pixel expression is written in the reference's form and the reference's order, so it is
//! bit-identical to it rather than merely within tolerance: `u0, v0, du, dv, l2` are hoisted to
//! compile time because they do not depend on the pixel, and `l2` stays a **divisor** rather than
//! becoming a precomputed reciprocal, because `x / l2` and `x * (1 / l2)` are not the same `f64`.
//!
//! Compiling uses the **stored position** spelling of mask space (`u = x · W/H`, `v = y`); the
//! per-pixel path receives the pixel-centre spelling from [`super::CompiledMask`]. The two agree to
//! `2.220e-16` and not bit for bit, so each is used only where the study froze it.
