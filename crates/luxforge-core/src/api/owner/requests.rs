//! The owner's request table: the first answer of every mutation whose method table entry declares
//! that the owner answers its retries (`Retries::Owner`). That is every method with the `request`
//! envelope, which changes nothing with a revision — the preset library, versions, the catalog's
//! import and artifact collection, module permissions, resources and capability jobs —
//! a module's settings writes, whose revision the settings file holds without a request log, and
//! `draft.commit`, whose first answer ends the draft its retry names, so the retry cannot reach the
//! catalog's log for the asset that draft edited.
//!
//! A retry, the same `request_id` in the same scope with the same method and parameters, is
//! answered with the first answer marked `deduplicated: true`, and its handler does not run, so it
//! changes nothing and emits no event. The same `request_id` with a different input is a
//! `conflict`. An asset's edits and history are deduplicated by the catalog, durably and in the same
//! write as the change, because a retry after a restart must be answered rather than refused as
//! stale. Every method here is safe to run again after a restart: it is a no-op, joins the work
//! already done, fails visibly on the uniqueness it would break, or, for a settings write, which
//! sets values rather than changing them, conflicts on the revision it was made against; a draft
//! does not outlive the owner, so a commit's retry after a restart is refused as naming no draft.
//! So the table lives with the owner, holds only successful answers, and is bounded.
