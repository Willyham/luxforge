//! The point worker: one thread that evaluates the point samples the catalog owner planned through a
//! spatial layer and answers each on the call's own reply channel, so another client's call never
//! waits behind a sample's tile.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! The owner plans a sample in `O(layers)` and hands the plan here with the reply channel its caller
//! is blocked on; it then moves on to its next message. The worker takes calls in the order they
//! were queued and answers each with the request's identity and the event sequence the owner had
//! when it planned it. A client's order is kept by construction: every transport serves one call at
//! a time per connection, so a client has at most one sample here. This is not the latest-wins
//! primitive ([`crate::latest`]): every queued sample was asked for by someone still waiting on it.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! One thread, started with the first sample and blocked on a condition variable while its queue is
//! empty (rule 8). At most [`POINT_QUEUE_CAPACITY`] calls wait behind the one being evaluated: one
//! per live loopback connection plus the desktop's one sample in flight. A full queue answers
//! `resource-limit` at once (rule 6). A disconnect drops that client's waiting calls, whose reply
//! channels close unanswered. The worker evaluates one sample at a time from the shared spatial
//! budget, and the tile's input is pulled serially, as it was on the owner: pulled on the shared
//! pool it would wait behind any render that holds the pool.
