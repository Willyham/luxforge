//! The owner's cache of hydrated history entries and of each asset's head.
//!
//! A history entry never changes once written: the catalog's `entries_are_immutable` trigger
//! refuses an update, and the stroke store it resolves against refuses one too. This service is the
//! catalog's only writer, over an exclusive connection, and every write takes `&mut self`. So an
//! entry read once, with its strokes resolved, is that entry for as long as the service is open, and
//! an asset's head — its row, its revision, its current entry and its redo list — changes only where
//! this service commits a write that moves it. Every such write is one `mutate`, which updates the
//! head in one place, after its transaction commits:
//!
//! - an action, a composite, a `mask.*` command and a restore append an entry: the new entry
//!   becomes current, one revision on, with nothing to redo;
//! - undo and redo navigate: the target becomes current, one revision on, with the redo list the
//!   navigation wrote;
//! - a no-op records only its request and moves nothing.
//!
//! No other write moves a head. An import inserts a new asset under a new identity, which no head or
//! entry here can name, so there is nothing to update, and a repeated import writes nothing; naming
//! or removing a version touches neither an entry nor a head; and reopening builds a new service,
//! whose cache starts empty.
//!
//! A write that fails updates nothing, because the catalog kept its prior state too.
//!
//! What is cached is only ever what the catalog returned — the entry decoded from its stored JSON,
//! the head read from its rows — and never a value a write built in memory, which could differ
//! from its stored spelling in the last bit of a float. The first read after a commit therefore
//! decodes the new entry once, and every read after it decodes nothing.
