//! The field-patch conformance suite: one set of checks every registered field-patch module passes.
//!
//! Basic, the Tone curve, the colour mixer, Presence, the vignette and the developer controls proof
//! share one implementation of everything but their field tables and their compilation
//! (`modules/field_patch.rs`), and the host behaviour they rely on — discovery, drafts, no-ops,
//! request deduplication, resets that keep a layer's identity, one layer per target, history,
//! sample-equals-render on both paths, unavailable providers and reopen — is the host's. So it is
//! proved here once, for every module the built-in registry and the developer controls proof hold
//! in the field-patch shape ([`shape::field_patches`]), over fields of every kind the field patch
//! holds, rather than once per module. The controls proof's layer changes no pixel, so it is held
//! to its payload rules and to rendering nothing, not to the editing journey. A module's own
//! numerics against its frozen reference, its placement and its unique behaviour stay in its own
//! tests; every `patch: true` action, field patch or not, keeps the generic patch check's rules
//! ([`rules::patch_actions`]).
//!
//! The suite is written against the public API only and returns its evidence instead of
//! asserting, so the same code runs as the core's integration test
//! (`tests/modules/field_patch.rs`, in the dev profile) and inside `cargo xtask
//! editor-acceptance` (compiled into `xtask` through a `#[path]` module, in release), which writes
//! what it returns as the acceptance evidence. The two cannot diverge because they are one
//! function. The JSON client it drives the owner with is `luxforge_testkit::client`, the one
//! xtask's acceptance chapters use.
