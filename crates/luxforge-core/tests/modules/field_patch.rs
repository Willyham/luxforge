//! Every field-patch module the built-in registry holds passes the one conformance suite in
//! `conformance/`: discovery, neutral payloads compiling to nothing and sharing the source, the
//! field-patch rules (which payloads read, how a patch and a reset plan, labels, descriptions and
//! values), one layer per target, drafts, no-ops, deduplication, resets that keep the layer's
//! identity, history, sample equal to render on the byte and linear paths and through a
//! straightened crop, an unavailable provider and reopen. `cargo xtask editor-acceptance` runs the
//! same function in release and records what it returns as evidence.
