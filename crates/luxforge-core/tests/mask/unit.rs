//! The production compiled mask against the frozen `f64` reference.
//!
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs` shares no code with `luxforge-core`'s sources, and
//! `docs/design/mask-study.md` freezes the mathematics both write. The bar here is **bit-identity**
//! rather than a tolerance: the production unit transcribes the reference's expressions in the
//! reference's order, so the same payloads, stage and pixel must produce the same `f64` bits. A
//! failure of these tests is a rewritten expression, not float noise — the study's Transcription
//! section lists what a rewrite costs, and each item in it is within tolerance and not bit-identical.
//!
//! The `bounds` rectangle and `min_feature_px` are not frozen by the study, so they are verified
//! here by exhaustive evaluation on small stages rather than against an oracle.
