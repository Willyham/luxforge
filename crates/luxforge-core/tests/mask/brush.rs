//! The brush component against the frozen study.
//!
//! The mathematics is `docs/design/mask-study.md#the-brush` and the oracle is the independent `f64`
//! reference at `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs`, which shares no code with production. What is asserted
//! here is **bit-identity**, not a tolerance: the production unit transcribes the study's
//! expressions in the study's order, so the two agree in their last bits or the transcription is
//! wrong.
//!
//! Everything a person can do to a brush component is covered from the outside: randomized strokes
//! at every size, feather, flow and erase flag; a one-point stroke and a doubled-back path; the
//! accumulation properties the design claims; the conservative rectangle, exhaustively on small
//! stages; the occupancy cap; and the measurement that the grid index is doing its job.
