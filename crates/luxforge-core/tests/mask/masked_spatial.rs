//! The masked **spatial** primitive through the public pipeline — a Presence layer bound
//! to a mask, on the JPEG byte path and on the RAW linear path.
//!
//! What this file proves, and what it deliberately does not. The Presence filter itself is frozen
//! elsewhere: `luxforge-reference`'s `studies/presence.rs`, `tests/modules/presence.rs` and `crates/luxforge-reference/src/presence.rs` are
//! the evidence that the units are right, and they pass unmodified because a mask changes nothing
//! about a unit, a halo, a tile or a global estimate. The blend algebra is frozen by
//! `mask/masked_colour.rs` against the independent `f64` oracle. What is new here is the *write*, so
//! this file asserts the write:
//!
//! - **The two endpoints carry no tolerance at all.** `M = 0` renders the operation's input frame
//!   byte for byte and `M = 1` renders the unmasked Presence frame byte for byte, on both paths.
//! - **A tile the mask cannot reach is a copy**: it holds the operation's input byte for byte. That
//!   no unit is evaluated over it is counted inside the crate, by the unit itself
//!   (`render::spatial`'s `a_tile_the_mask_cannot_reach_evaluates_no_unit`), because the count is
//!   not public API.
//! - **A sample equals the rendered byte** inside the mask, outside it and on the bounds edge, on
//!   both paths, which is the delivered one-tile exception and not a second one.
//! - A partially covered frame lies strictly between the two endpoint frames, which is what a
//!   blend is; where it lands between them is the oracle's business and `mask/masked_colour.rs` asserts
//!   it there.
