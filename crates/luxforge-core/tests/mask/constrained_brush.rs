//! The colour-constrained brush, against the frozen study and end to end through the
//! service every client reaches.
//!
//! The mathematics is `docs/design/mask-study.md#the-colour-constraint` and the oracle is the
//! independent `f64` reference at `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs`, which shares no code with production.
//! What is asserted is **bit-identity** and not a tolerance: the similarity is the frozen colour
//! range's own falloff at one sample, written in the reference's order, so the two agree in their
//! last bits or the transcription is wrong.
//!
//! What else is proved here, each named by the thing it protects:
//!
//! * **The seed is the host's, never the client's.** `mask.add-stroke` carries a flag and a path and
//!   no colour at all, and the host reads the pixel the operation the mask modulates receives at the
//!   position the stroke began. A client cannot put a colour the photograph does not have there into
//!   a stroke, because there is no field for one.
//! * **The seed is stored, and read once.** It is part of the stroke's canonical bytes, so a limited
//!   stroke reproduces its own limit after any later edit and nothing is sampled again at render
//!   time.
//! * **The sample equals the render.** A point sample through a limited stroke equals the rendered
//!   byte, on the same shared call every other component reaches the mask through.
//! * **It is a colour test and not Auto Mask.** A limited stroke stops at a colour boundary it
//!   crosses *and* paints the same colour on the far side of the frame, which is the difference the
//!   user guide states in one sentence.
