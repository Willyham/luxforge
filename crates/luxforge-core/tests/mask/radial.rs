//! The production `radial` component kind against the frozen `f64` reference.
//!
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs` shares no code with `luxforge-core`'s sources, and
//! `docs/design/mask-study.md` freezes the mathematics both write. The bar here is the same as the
//! linear kind's in `mask/unit.rs`: **bit-identity** rather than a tolerance, because the production
//! unit transcribes the reference's expressions in the reference's order. A failure of these tests
//! is a rewritten expression, not float noise — the study's Transcription section lists what a
//! rewrite costs, and every item in it is within tolerance and not bit-identical.
//!
//! What the study does not freeze is verified here by exhaustive evaluation on small stages instead:
//! the conservative `bounds` rectangle of a rotated ellipse, and `min_feature_px`.
