//! The combination vocabulary, proved where it matters — in **pixels**.
//!
//! Two questions this file answers that no earlier mask test could:
//!
//! 1. A mask holding components of *several kinds*, in every mode, with inversions at both levels,
//!    a whole-mask amount and a whole-mask inversion, **renders** exactly as the independent `f64`
//!    reference composes it. `mask/unit.rs` and `mask/radial.rs` compare the coverage *field*
//!    against that reference; this compares the frame a person would see, over randomized component
//!    lists, through the same public render path a client reaches.
//! 2. A **radial gradient** goes end to end: created, added to as a second kind, patched on a
//!    radius, an angle and a feather, committed and rendered, through the generated `mask.*` methods
//!    and the delivered `edit.set-basic` target. That is the gap the generated geometry methods
//!    close — until they existed the radial was evaluable and not creatable — and it is proved with
//!    bytes rather than with a stack listing.
//!
//! The oracle is `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs`, which shares no code with `luxforge-core`, composed
//! with `luxforge-reference`'s sRGB and exposure reference and its mask module's own `blend`,
//! `out = (1 − M)·in + M·effect(in)`. The numerical rule is the delivered colour studies': a
//! rendered code equals the reference's code exactly, except where the reference's linear value sits
//! within `1e-6 + 1e-6·|threshold|` of a code threshold, where one code is permitted because
//! production decodes, multiplies and blends in `f32`.
