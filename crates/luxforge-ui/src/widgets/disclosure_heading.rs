//! A section heading that opens and closes its section: the capitalised label, an optional caption
//! and a chevron, [`theme::DISCLOSURE_HEADING_HEIGHT`] tall, with the whole row one button.
//!
//! It is a list heading (History, Recipe) that also discloses, so its label is drawn exactly as
//! [`super::list_heading`] draws one and starts at the same left edge, with no inset of its own.
//! Hovering lifts the label and the chevron from tertiary to secondary together; the caption keeps
//! its colour, because it reports state rather than offering the action.
