//! A transparent wrapper that turns a double-click anywhere over its content into one message,
//! even when the content captures the press itself.
//!
//! Iced's `mouse_area` forwards every event to its content first and only then looks at it, so a
//! child that captures the left press — iced's `slider` does, to start a drag — hides the press
//! from it and a double-click over the child is never seen. This widget does the opposite: it
//! inspects the press first, and when the press is the second click of a double click it publishes
//! its message, captures the event and does **not** forward it, so the content never starts a
//! gesture the reset is about to undo.
//!
//! What that means on a slider rail is worth saying plainly, because it is visible:
//!
//! - A double-click on the rail **away from the handle** is a jump and then a reset. The first
//!   click reaches the slider, which moves the handle to the pointer and commits that value on
//!   release; the second click is swallowed here and resets the field. The committed jump stays in
//!   history as its own entry, and the host holds the reset until that commit has answered, so the
//!   reset names the revision the jump produced.
//! - A double-click **on the handle's own position** is a reset alone: iced's slider publishes no
//!   value when the pointer maps to the value the handle already has, so the first click commits
//!   nothing.
//!
//! Everything that is not a left press is forwarded unchanged, so the content keeps every other
//! event — including the release that ends a drag the first click started.
