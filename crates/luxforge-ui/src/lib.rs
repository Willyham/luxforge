//! Luxforge's widget library: the Develop workspace's visual language and generated controls.
//!
//! This crate depends on Iced only. It never depends on `luxforge-core`, and no test here links
//! it. That boundary is deliberate, for three reasons. First, it is enforced by the compiler
//! rather than by review: with no `luxforge-core` type in scope, nothing in this crate can reach
//! the catalog owner's authoritative state, validate a parameter against a module descriptor, or
//! construct an `edit.*` request — every widget here is therefore structurally unable to hold
//! editing logic, and takes plain data structs, enums and message values or closures instead.
//! Second, it is a compile-unit boundary: a styling or layout change here rebuilds this crate and
//! `luxforge-app`, never `luxforge-core`, so widget churn never lengthens the core's own build.
//! Third, the split is free at runtime: this crate links into the same desktop binary as
//! everything else and holds only pure functions and constants, so it starts no process, no
//! thread and no timer of its own — it adds no startup work beyond what any other Rust module
//! would.
