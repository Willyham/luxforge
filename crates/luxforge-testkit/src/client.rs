//! An independent JSON client of the catalog owner: every call is one request through
//! [`OwnerHandle::call`], exactly as a script or an agent reaches the editor, with no desktop. The
//! field-patch conformance suite and xtask's acceptance chapters drive the owner with it, so they
//! share one request, refusal, job-wait and mutation-envelope implementation.
//!
//! A check here returns what it found broken as a [`Checked`] error instead of panicking, so the
//! same code runs as a test (which panics with the message) and inside `cargo xtask
//! editor-acceptance` (which records it as evidence).
