//! The sampler's cost with this process's GPU clients holding real `AppUsage` entries: a cold
//! read, which walks every accelerator's children, against a warm one, which asks only the cached
//! clients. It is a timing, not a check, so it is ignored; run it in release on a quiet machine:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --release --locked -p luxforge-process --test cost -- --ignored --nocapture

//!
//! Only macOS has GPU clients to walk, so only there is there anything to time.
