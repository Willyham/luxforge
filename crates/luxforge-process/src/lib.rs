//! Small, safe wrappers around platform FFI: process CPU and memory counters, GPU counters where
//! reported, and the Windows file change time used to verify source signatures.
//!
//! The platform code is FFI, so it lives in this leaf crate, the second one allowed `unsafe` after
//! `luxforge-raw`. Every `unsafe` block sits beside a `SAFETY:` comment and nothing unsafe crosses
//! the public API. A counter the platform cannot give is an [`Unavailable`] with a reason a person
//! can read, never a zero, so a monitor can tell "nothing used" from "nothing known".
//!
//! Every time and byte counter here is cumulative or a current level taken at the call; a rate
//! comes from two reads and the caller's own monotonic clock.
