//! Independent f64 reference for the frozen range-selection mathematics:
//! the luminance band and the Oklab colour range.
//!
//! This module shares no code with production — there is no production range
//! code yet, and when there is, this file is the oracle it cannot influence,
//! matching the convention `crates/luxforge-reference/src/mask.rs` and
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/vignette.rs` set. The frozen equations, every constant's
//! justification and every measured figure are written out in full in
//! `docs/design/range-study.md`; this file is their literal transcription, in
//! the same order and the same spelling, and the two must be read together. A
//! production unit that writes the same expressions in the same order is
//! bit-identical to this reference rather than merely within tolerance of it.
//!
//! Three deliberate reuses, so the editor keeps one of each rather than two
//! that differ for no reason a person could name:
//!
//! * the falloff is [`super::mask::smooth`], the shape the vignette froze and
//!   the mask study reuses;
//! * the luminance axis is [`super::tone::luminance`] composed with
//!   [`super::tone::encode_srgb_extended`], the delivered Basic layer's own
//!   Rec. 709 luminance and its analytically continued sRGB OETF;
//! * the colour space is [`super::colour`]'s Oklab, accepted by
//!   `docs/design/basic-colour.md` and reused unchanged by the mixer study.
//!
//! Domain: every function takes and returns plain `f64` and validates nothing.
//! Legality of a stored payload is [`feather_is_legal`] and [`refine_is_legal`],
//! which state the frozen rules but are not applied automatically; production
//! rejects an illegal payload before any of this is reached. Given finite
//! inputs that satisfy those rules, every step below is finite: the only
//! divisions are by a feather the rules bound away from zero (with an explicit
//! hard-edge branch for a feather that is exactly zero) and by a radius the
//! refine mapping bounds below by [`RADIUS_MIN`].
//!
//! Unlike the geometric components, a range component reads the **pixel value**
//! the operation it modulates receives, not the pixel's position. Every
//! consequence of that — the compiled-mask signature, the bounds rectangle, the
//! proxy phase and what a reordered layer selects — is in the study.
