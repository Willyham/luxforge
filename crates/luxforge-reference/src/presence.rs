//! Independent f64 whole-frame reference for the frozen Presence units: Dehaze,
//! Texture and Clarity.
//!
//! This module shares no code with production. It exists so a later production
//! implementation of the `luxforge.presence` spatial operation has an oracle it
//! cannot influence. The frozen equations are written out in full in
//! `docs/design/presence-study.md`; this file is their literal transcription, and
//! the two must be read together. Every constant below is named identically to the
//! constant of the same name in that document.
//!
//! Domain: linear-sRGB (D65) `f64` RGB, with no gamut clamp and no rounding, matching
//! the spatial-primitive contract in `docs/design/presence-mixer-vignette.md`: values
//! outside `[0, 1]` and negative values are preserved between units, and the host
//! clamps and quantizes only at the output boundary.
//!
//! **Tile invariance is the point of the structure below.** Every filter is a
//! finite-support box, min or box-based guided filter evaluated by direct summation
//! over its window in a fixed order, and every plane carries the frame it belongs to
//! plus the sub-rectangle it actually holds. Reads outside the frame clamp to the
//! frame edge; reads outside the held rectangle panic. A caller that asks for an
//! output rectangle while holding only the rectangle plus the declared halo therefore
//! gets bit-identical results to the whole-frame evaluation, or a panic — never a
//! silently different answer. `studies/presence.rs` uses exactly that to prove the
//! declared halos are sufficient.
//!
//! The sRGB transfer function is transcribed here from the standard constants rather
//! than imported from `reference::tone`, so a parallel study's edits to that file
//! cannot change this study's frozen numbers.
