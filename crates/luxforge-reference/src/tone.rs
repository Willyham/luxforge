//! Independent f64 reference for the frozen global Tone algorithm.
//!
//! This module shares no code with production. It exists so a later production
//! implementation of the `luxforge.basic.adjust` tone unit has an oracle it
//! cannot influence. The frozen equations are written out in full in
//! `docs/design/basic-tone.md`; this file is their literal transcription, and
//! the two must be read together. Every constant below is named identically to
//! the constant of the same name in that document.
//!
//! Domain: this reference takes and returns linear-sRGB (D65) `f64` triples, with
//! no gamut clamp and no rounding, matching the "Pointwise colour processing"
//! section of `docs/design/basic-and-histogram.md`: values outside `[0, 1]` and
//! negative values are preserved, and the host quantizes only at the output
//! boundary, not here.
