//! Independent f64 reference for the frozen mask coverage mathematics.
//!
//! This module shares no code with production — there is no production mask
//! code yet, and when there is, this file is the oracle it cannot influence,
//! matching the convention `crates/luxforge-reference/src/vignette.rs` set. The frozen
//! equations are written out in full in `docs/design/mask-study.md`; this file
//! is their literal transcription, in the same order and the same spelling, and
//! the two must be read together. A later production unit that writes the same
//! expressions in the same order is bit-identical to this reference rather than
//! merely within tolerance of it.
//!
//! Two spellings are deliberately distinct and must not be interchanged:
//! `Stage::pixel_uv` maps a content-stage pixel index to mask space and is what
//! a rasterizing pass and `render.sample` both call; `Stage::position_uv` maps a
//! stored normalized payload coordinate to mask space and is what compiling a
//! component calls. They agree mathematically and to within the frozen
//! tolerance, but not bit for bit (measured in the `studies` binary's `mask` module), so each
//! caller uses the one for its own input.
//!
//! Domain: every function takes and returns plain `f64` and validates nothing.
//! Legality of a stored payload is [`distance_is_legal`] and [`axis_is_legal`],
//! which state the frozen rules but are not applied automatically; production
//! rejects an illegal payload before any of this is reached, exactly as
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/vignette.rs` states for its own inputs. Given finite inputs
//! that satisfy those rules, every step below is finite: the only divisions are
//! by an axis length or a radius the rules bound away from zero, and by a
//! feather span guarded by an explicit hard-edge branch.

/// The content stage a mask is evaluated against: the stage every pixel-,
/// colour- and spatial-stage layer already addresses.
