//! Independent f64 reference for the frozen post-crop vignette.
//!
//! This module shares no code with production, matching the convention set by
//! `crates/luxforge-reference/src/tone.rs`: it exists so a later production implementation of
//! the `luxforge.vignette` module has an oracle it cannot influence. The
//! frozen equations are written out in full in `docs/design/vignette-study.md`;
//! this file is their literal transcription and the two must be read together.
//! Every constant and formula below is named to match that document.
//!
//! The one exception to "shares no code" is deliberate and narrow: the
//! positive-amount branch works in the same analytically-continued sRGB
//! working domain the Tone study already froze (see `docs/design/basic-tone.md`
//! "Working tone domain"), so this file reuses `encode_srgb_extended` and
//! `decode_srgb_extended` from `crates/luxforge-reference/src/tone.rs` rather than
//! duplicating the sRGB OETF a third time in this test tree; it does not reuse
//! any of Tone's curve stages, which are unrelated to the vignette.
//!
//! Domain: `mask` and `apply` take and return plain `f64`/`[f64; 3]` with no
//! gamut clamp beyond what the frozen equations themselves guarantee (the
//! positive branch is proved never to exceed encoded `1`; the negative branch
//! never produces a value farther from zero than the input). Non-finite
//! *inputs* are out of scope for this reference, exactly as `tone.rs` states:
//! production refuses them before this stage is reached, matching the host's
//! "non-finite after any unit is an explicit render/sample error" rule.
