//! The numerical studies: each proves one reference's own properties, and those that freeze a
//! committed fixture corpus generate it (ignored) and reload it on every run. None of them touches
//! the core; the core's tests check production against the references and these corpora.
//!
//! One binary, one module per study, so a study is filtered by its module name: `cargo test -p
//! luxforge-reference --test studies tone::`.
