//! The `performance` smoke scenario: the state panel's Performance section on the real editor, over
//! the generated 60 MP JPEG at 1440 × 900.
//!
//! Its frames, in [`plan`] order: the photograph opened with the section open, as every launch
//! starts it, and sampling; a 3.6 s wait, by which the one-second sampler has read at least four
//! times; a 3° straighten; a Presence commit of all three fields over it, whose exact render at
//! 60 MP runs long enough to be listed as long work; a wait after which that render is listed as finished; the
//! section collapsed; a 2.5 s wait in which nothing more is read; and the section opened again,
//! captured on its first read of a fresh window.
//!
//! Each frame is checked against its own recorded answers, re-derived here without the editor's
//! code: the memory figure against the recorded `resources.read`, the CPU and GPU figures against a
//! rate computed from the last two recorded reads, the series lengths against the sample count, and
//! the job rows and heading caption against the recorded `activity.list` under the section's display
//! rules. The runner also reads the editor's memory from outside while it runs — `ps` for resident
//! memory and `footprint` for the physical footprint Activity Monitor shows — and compares each
//! frame's recorded figures with its own readings taken at the same wall-clock moment. The collapsed
//! frames prove the section asleep: the reads asked for and the samples held stay exactly where
//! they were, and the reopened frame proves that opening clears the window and reads at once.
//! Everything compared is written to `app/performance-checks.json`.
//!
//! With `--source RAW` the heavy step is the same, over a photograph of 24 to 40 MP; that run is not
//! part of `rendered`, because no RAW photograph is checked in.
