//! The smoke runner: every scenario is one row of [`SCENARIOS`], and every row runs through
//! [`launch_all`] unless its shape needs a function of its own. A row names the scenario, its
//! launches — each with the [`Plan`] its script and frame count are derived from — the scenario's
//! own checks, what it opens and the window it opens at. `smoke --list`, [`dispatch`], the replay
//! and `verify`'s rendered tier all read the table, so a new scenario is one row.
