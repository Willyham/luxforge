//! The `mask-range` smoke scenario: phase D's claim, which is that a deterministic per-pixel
//! selection is worth having **and** that what it cannot do is worth saying.
//!
//! Two launches over one catalog. The first types a luminance band, intersects a gradient with it,
//! applies an adjustment through the result and shows the band taking a grey card along with the sky
//! it was drawn for; then intersects a colour range, picks the sky off the photograph and shows the
//! grey card come back; then puts a `+0.75 EV` layer **ahead** of the masked one and shows the band
//! stop selecting the sky altogether; then asks the composed mask and each component for its overlay,
//! where all four grids are drawn and the two range components' own grids show the failure and its
//! remedy as pictures. The second reopens
//! that catalog and takes the colour range's own limits one at a time — a sampled grey selecting every
//! neutral, a second swatch adding a colour, a third changing nothing, and one person's skin selecting
//! another's — and finishes with the colour-constrained brush: one stroke across two surfaces, and a
//! colour-held erase that takes one of them back out and leaves the other alone — read from the
//! picture and then from that mask's own overlay, which a colour-held stroke used to have none of.
//!
//! **Why the readings are taken from the photograph as well as from the overlay.** Every claim this
//! scenario makes about what a selection selects is read from the rendered photograph with an
//! adjustment applied through the mask, because that is the picture a person is actually editing. The
//! overlay is now read too, and read **against** those same frames: a mask that reads pixels is
//! answered on the input of its first bound layer ([proposal P16](../../docs/design/range-study.md#proposals),
//! decided by the owner on 2026-09-23), so the composed mask's grid and the frame the masked Exposure
//! produced are two views of one selection and are checked patch by patch against each other. The
//! overlay at Fit is still read on a downscaled pixel and the 100% view is still the truth; what the
//! grid buys is that a selection can be *seen* rather than only inferred.
//!
//! **Why the comparisons are against a control inside the same frame.** A value-based selection moves
//! when a layer ahead of it changes the operation's input, and proving that by predicting an output
//! code would be proving the arithmetic twice. The fixture instead holds the **same** sky colour in two
//! places and the mask's gradient reaches one of them, so the claim is read as an equality between two
//! patches of one frame: while the band selects the sky, the two differ by the masked adjustment, and
//! once a layer ahead of it has moved the sky off the band they are equal again.
//!
//! Positions are normalized content coordinates — `x` a fraction of the content stage's width, `y` of
//! its height — which is what a script paints and sweeps in. A pick is in **output-stage pixels**,
//! which is what `render.locate` takes and what the canvas publishes.
//!
//! Each launch is a [`Plan`]: every frame it captures, named by the step that produces it, with what
//! that step commits and records. [`verify`] reads the frames by those names for everything a plan
//! cannot say — above all what the photograph and its overlay show.
