//! The `presence` smoke scenario: the section's own expand, a Clarity drag and cancel, Texture,
//! Clarity and Dehaze each committed, all three at once through the raw API, and the module reset,
//! on the real editor.
//!
//! The fixture is `fixtures/generated/presence.jpg` (`cargo xtask generate-fixtures`): the golden
//! `orientation-1` fixture has only hard flat-colour edges and flat fields, with no smooth gradient
//! and nothing at Texture's own fine medium-frequency band, so none of the three units has anything
//! to visibly act on there. The generated fixture holds, in one quadrant each: a smooth gradient, a
//! hard step edge (for Clarity's local-contrast gain and, at 100%, its halo), a low-amplitude
//! checker at Texture's own frozen fine/coarse radii for this fixture's long side (a *high*-contrast
//! checker reads as an edge to the frozen guided-filter pair and is left alone, per
//! `docs/design/presence-study.md`; a period-2 checker is not a usable probe either, so the fixture
//! uses an 8-pixel period, the widest-gain period this study's units produce at this fixture's long
//! side), and a flat mid-grey deep enough in from every edge to clear Clarity's own reduced-grid base
//! radius, which the "flat field stays flat" and "grey stays grey" checks below read.
