//! Rendered evidence for module capabilities: the developer proof module driven through the
//! desktop's own capability section, task control and consent notice, against a loopback
//! [`ProofEndpoint`] this process starts. The editor runs hidden in the background harness with
//! `--developer --proof-endpoint`, so its settings, grants, resources and in-memory secret store
//! live inside the evidence directory.
//!
//! The script's secret steps carry a sentinel key, so the script itself is written outside the
//! output directory and removed after the run; the copy kept beside the evidence is redacted, and
//! the editor records those steps redacted too. Every file under the output directory is scanned
//! for the sentinel afterwards.
