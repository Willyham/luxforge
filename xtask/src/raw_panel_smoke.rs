//! The `raw-panel` smoke scenario: the RAW section as the tools panel draws it for a real RAW
//! source, with Basic collapsed so the RAW section sits under the histogram; a Custom temperature
//! drag left open, whose drafted frame approximates the white balance on the developed planes and
//! is labelled so, then released, which redevelops the mosaic and lands the exact frame, at Fit
//! and again at 100%. At 100%, a held-draft pause checks the exact visible-region refinement and
//! captures full-detail approximate pixels for white-balance accuracy against the release.
//! Both drags keep the tint in force (the first, from As shot, the camera's as-shot
//! tint); and a double-click reset on each of the three sliders after the committed
//! drag the first press makes: exposure back to 0 EV, and the custom temperature and tint back to
//! As shot, whose fields then show the camera's as-shot equivalent. The RAW band carries no edited
//! dot on the untouched photograph and again once the resets leave As shot at 0 EV; and a crop drafted on
//! the RAW's whole input stage, straightened by 7°, applied at Fit, read at 100% and replaced through
//! the API's `crop-fit`, each commit checked to be the picture on screen.
//!
//! No RAW photograph is checked in (see `fixtures/README.md`), so this scenario is outside the
//! rendered tier of [`crate::smoke::SCENARIOS`] and takes its source from `--source`: an owner or raw.pixls.us file
//! the editor supports. It proves what the panel shows, what its double-click does and that a RAW
//! crop is drawn and shown, not RAW decoding, which `raw-editor` covers.
