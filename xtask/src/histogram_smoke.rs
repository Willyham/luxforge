//! The `histogram` smoke scenario: the inspector, the clipping overlays and the pointer readout.
//!
//! The fixture is the ordinary `orientation-1` pattern, whose clipped pixels are known from the
//! generator rather than guessed: four quadrant colours with no channel at an endpoint, a white
//! centre line and arrow (every channel at 255), and a band of black dashes across the middle
//! (every channel at 0). Nothing in it has one channel at 0 and another at 255, so the scenario
//! commits one `edit.set-pixel` of `(0, 128, 255)` to make exactly one both-endpoint pixel — which
//! is also the isolated-clipped-pixel case the contract asks the Fit overlay to survive. The pixel
//! proof is a test module, so the scenario's one launch is a developer launch.
//!
//! Every count a frame reports is checked against `analysis::reduce` of an **independent**
//! core render of the same fixture through the same recipe, so the plot is verified against the
//! reducer rather than against itself — and so are the words the triangles' tooltips state them in.
//!
//! The inspector is the plot with the triangles in its bottom corners and nothing else, with no
//! caption; the pointer readout is in the status bar. The hover frame is compared with the frame
//! before it pixel for pixel: the tools panel is identical, and the status bar changes only inside
//! the readout's own slot.
