//! Desktop control-to-uploaded-frame measurement: the real editor, gesture and GPU upload.
//!
//! [`editor_performance`](crate::editor_performance) measures `render` on the catalog owner's own
//! thread. Nothing there schedules, uploads or presents, so it cannot answer the responsiveness
//! question the [Basic design][design] asks: how long after a slider input the frame carrying that
//! input is on screen. This module answers it by driving the shipped binary in a background
//! evidence launch, with one `slider` script step per input, and reading the timestamps out of the
//! run's own `events.jsonl`. The default measures Basic's exposure slider; `--control curve`
//! measures the developer proof curve while its canvas is visible in the tools panel.
//!
//! What "presented" means here: the update in which the rendered raster became the photo surface's
//! source, recorded as `preview_displayed`. The photograph is drawn by a primitive that owns its
//! texture, so there is no upload message to wait for and no separate upload figure to report.
//! That is the moment the rendered pixels have been handed to the renderer as a texture and the
//! canvas draws them from the next frame on. It is **not** display scanout, which this harness
//! cannot observe; every figure is therefore an upper bound on the editor's own work and a lower
//! bound on what an eye sees.
//!
//! `--action <id> --parameter <name>` drives any other field-patch slider through the same
//! draft.begin/set/commit path, in place of the default Basic exposure: [`FieldTarget::lookup`]
//! reads the parameter's declared range and step from the module registry (what `module.list`
//! answers), so every generated gesture value the harness sends is one that action would actually
//! accept. That includes a RAW temperature or tint, whose drafted values the core previews
//! approximately on the developed planes; the frames say so (`approximate_white_balance`) and the
//! report counts them, and the release still redevelops the mosaic before the committed frame.
//!
